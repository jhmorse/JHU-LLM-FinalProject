14321,07/29/2025,Ending Crime and Disorder on America's Streets,"35817 vol. 90, no. 143 tuesday, july 29, 2025 title 3— executive order 14321 of july 24, 2025 the president ending crime and disorder on america’s streets by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose and policy. endemic vagrancy, disorderly behavior, sud den confrontations, and violent attacks have made our cities unsafe. the number of individuals living on the streets in the united states on a single night during the last year of the previous administration—274,224—was the highest ever recorded. the overwhelming majority of these individuals are addicted to drugs, have a mental health condition, or both. nearly two-thirds of homeless individuals report having regularly used hard drugs like methamphetamines, cocaine, or opioids in their lifetimes. an equally large share of homeless individuals reported suffering from mental health conditions. the federal government and the states have spent tens of billions of dollars on failed programs that address homelessness but not its root causes, leaving other citizens vulnerable to public safety threats. shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order. surrendering our cities and citizens to disorder and fear is neither compassionate to the homeless nor other citizens. my administration will take a new approach focused on protecting public safety. sec. 2. restoring civil commitment. (a) the attorney general, in consultation with the secretary of health and human services, shall take appropriate action to: (i) seek, in appropriate cases, the reversal of federal or state judicial precedents and the termination of consent decrees that impede the united states’ policy of encouraging civil commitment of individuals with mental illness who pose risks to themselves or the public or are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves in appropriate facilities for appro priate periods of time; and (ii) provide assistance to state and local governments, through technical guidance, grants, or other legally available means, for the identification, adoption, and implementation of maximally flexible civil commitment, institutional treatment, and ‘‘step-down’’ treatment standards that allow for the appropriate commitment and treatment of individuals with mental illness who pose a danger to others or are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves. sec. 3. fighting vagrancy on america’s streets. (a) the attorney general, the secretary of health and human services, the secretary of housing and urban development, and the secretary of transportation shall take immediate steps to assess their discretionary grant programs and determine whether priority for those grants may be given to grantees in states and municipalities that actively meet the below criteria, to the maximum extent permitted by law: khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc (i) enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use; (ii) enforce prohibitions on urban camping and loitering; (iii) enforce prohibitions on urban squatting; (iv) enforce, and where necessary, adopt, standards that address individuals who are a danger to themselves or others and suffer from serious mental illness or substance use disorder, or who are living on the streets and 35818 federal register / vol. 90, no. 143 / tuesday, july 29, 2025 / presidential documents cannot care for themselves, through assisted outpatient treatment or by moving them into treatment centers or other appropriate facilities via civil commitment or other available means, to the maximum extent per mitted by law; or (v) substantially implement and comply with, to the extent required, the registration and notification obligations of the sex offender registry and notification act, particularly in the case of registered sex offenders with no fixed address, including by adequately mapping and checking the location of homeless sex offenders. (b) the attorney general shall: (i) ensure that homeless individuals arrested for federal crimes are evalu ated, consistent with 18 u.s.c. 4248, to determine whether they are sexu ally dangerous persons and certified accordingly for civil commitment; (ii) take all necessary steps to ensure the availability of funds under the emergency federal law enforcement assistance program to support, as consistent with 34 u.s.c. 50101 et seq., encampment removal efforts in areas for which public safety is at risk and state and local resources are inadequate; (iii) assess federal resources to determine whether they may be directed toward ensuring, to the extent permitted by law, that detainees with serious mental illness are not released into the public because of a lack of forensic bed capacity at appropriate local, state, and federal jails or hospitals; and (iv) enhance requirements that prisons and residential reentry centers that are under the authority of the attorney general or receive funding from the attorney general require in-custody housing release plans and, to the maximum extent practicable, require individuals to comply. sec. 4. redirecting federal resources toward effective methods of addressing homelessness. (a) the secretary of health and human services shall take appropriate action to: (i) ensure that discretionary grants issued by the substance abuse and mental health services administration for substance use disorder preven tion, treatment, and recovery fund evidence-based programs and do not fund programs that fail to achieve adequate outcomes, including so-called ‘‘harm reduction’’ or ‘‘safe consumption’’ efforts that only facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm; (ii) provide technical assistance to assisted outpatient treatment programs for individuals with serious mental illness or addiction during and after the civil commitment process focused on shifting such individuals off of the streets and public programs and into private housing and support networks; and (iii) ensure that federal funds for federally qualified health centers and certified community behavioral health clinics reduce rather than promote homelessness by supporting, to the maximum extent permitted by law, comprehensive services for individuals with serious mental illness and substance use disorder, including crisis intervention services. (b) the attorney general shall prioritize available funding to support the expansion of drug courts and mental health courts for individuals for which such diversion serves public safety. sec. 5. increasing accountability and safety in america’s homelessness programs. (a) the secretary of health and human services and the secretary of housing and urban development shall take appropriate actions to increase khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc accountability in their provision of, and grants awarded for, homelessness assistance and transitional living programs. these actions shall include, to the extent permitted by law, ending support for ‘‘housing first’’ policies that deprioritize accountability and fail to promote treatment, recovery, and self-sufficiency; increasing competition among grantees through broadening the applicant pool; and holding grantees to higher standards of effectiveness in reducing homelessness and increasing public safety. (b) the secretary of housing and urban development shall, as appropriate, take steps to require recipients of federal housing and homelessness assist ance to increase requirements that persons participating in the recipients’ programs who suffer from substance use disorder or serious mental illness use substance abuse treatment or mental health services as a condition of participation. (c) with respect to recipients of federal housing and homelessness assist ance that operate drug injection sites or ‘‘safe consumption sites,’’ knowingly distribute drug paraphernalia, or permit the use or distribution of illicit drugs on property under their control: (i) the attorney general shall review whether such recipients are in viola tion of federal law, including 21 u.s.c. 856, and bring civil or criminal actions in appropriate cases; and (ii) the secretary of housing and urban development, in coordination with the attorney general, shall review whether such recipients are in violation of the terms of the programs pursuant to which they receive federal housing and homelessness assistance and freeze their assistance as appropriate. (d) the secretary of housing and urban development shall take appropriate measures and revise regulations as necessary to allow, where permissible under applicable law, federally funded programs to exclusively house women and children and to stop sex offenders who receive homelessness assistance through such programs from being housed with unrelated children. (e) the secretary of housing and urban development, in consultation with the attorney general and the secretary of health and human services, shall, as appropriate and to the extent permitted by law: (i) allow or require the recipients of federal funding for homelessness assistance to collect health-related information that the secretary of hous ing and urban development identifies as necessary to the effective and efficient operation of the funding program from all persons to whom such assistance is provided; and (ii) require those funding recipients to share such data with law enforce ment authorities in circumstances permitted by law and to use the collected health data to provide appropriate medical care to individuals with mental health diagnoses or to connect individuals to public health resources. sec. 6. general provisions. (a) nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the director of the office of management and budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) this order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) this order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the united states, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc 35820 federal register / vol. 90, no. 143 / tuesday, july 29, 2025 / presidential documents (d) the costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the department of housing and urban development. the white house, july 24, 2025.

14322,07/29/2025,Saving College Sports,"presidential documents executive order 14322 of july 24, 2025 saving college sports by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose and policy. college sports are a uniquely american institution that provide life-changing educational and leadership-develop ment opportunities to more than 500,000 student-athletes through almost $4 billion in scholarships each year. college athletics also provide substantial support to local economies and form an indelible part of family activities, pastimes, and culture in many communities. while major college football games can draw tens of millions of television viewers and attendees, they feature only a very small sample of the many athletes who benefit from the transformational opportunities that college athletics provide. sixty-five percent of the 2024 united states olympic team members were current or former national collegiate athletic association (ncaa) varsity athletes, and approximately seventy-five percent were colle giate athletes. the 2024 united states olympic team earned 126 total medals, leading the overall medal count for the eighth consecutive summer olympic games. beyond driving our unrivaled success in international competition, college athletes are more likely to report better outcomes in important respects during college and after graduation. a substantial majority of female execu tives at the largest american companies participated in sports during adoles cence, many at the high school or collegiate level, and examples of business leaders and former presidents who played college sports are legion. it is no exaggeration to say that america’s system of collegiate athletics plays an integral role in forging the leaders that drive our nation’s success. yet the future of college sports is under unprecedented threat. waves of recent litigation against collegiate athletics governing rules have eliminated limits on athlete compensation, pay-for-play recruiting inducements, and transfers between universities, unleashing a sea change that threatens the viability of college sports. while changes providing some increased benefits and flexibility to student-athletes were overdue and should be maintained, the inability to maintain reasonable rules and guardrails is a mortal threat to most college sports. to illustrate, following a 2021 antitrust ruling from the united states su preme court striking down ncaa restrictions, the ncaa changed its rules to permit players to receive compensation for their name, image, and likeness (nil) from third parties. but guardrails designed to ensure that these were legitimate, market-value nil payments for endorsements or similar services, rather than simply pay-for-play inducements, were eliminated through litiga tion. other limits on player transfers among schools were also taken down through litigation. this has created an out-of-control, rudderless system in which competing khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc2 university donors engage in bidding wars for the best players, who can change teams each season. meanwhile, more than 30 states have passed their own nil laws in a chaotic race to the bottom, sometimes to gain temporary competitive advantages for their major collegiate teams. as a result, players at some universities will receive more than $50 million per year, mostly for the revenue-generating sports like football. entering the 2024 season, players on the eventual college football national champion 35822 federal register / vol. 90, no. 143 / tuesday, july 29, 2025 / presidential documents team were being paid around $20 million annually. by the 2025 season, football players at one university will reportedly be paid $35–40 million, with revenue-sharing included. this not only reduces competition and parity by creating an oligarchy of teams that can simply buy the best players—including the best players from less-wealthy programs at the end of each season—but the imperative that university donors must devote ever-escalating resources to compete in the revenue-generating sports like football and basketball siphons away the resources necessary to support the panoply of non-revenue sports. absent guardrails to stop the madness and ensure a reasonable, balanced use of resources across collegiate athletic programs that preserves their educational and developmental benefits, many college sports will soon cease to exist. a national solution is urgently needed to prevent this situation from deterio rating beyond repair and to protect non-revenue sports, including many women’s sports, that comprise the backbone of intercollegiate athletics, drive american superiority at the olympics and other international competitions, and catalyze hundreds of thousands of student-athletes to fuel american success in myriad ways. attempting to create some guardrails and shelter from litigation, colleges have adopted a new regime, deciding to pay athletes directly and simulta neously limit the total number of athletes on their campuses. given that the new roster limits, by exceeding the scholarship limits they replace, will increase the potential number of scholarships available in many sports, this opportunity must be utilized to strengthen and expand non-revenue sports. simultaneously, the third-party market of pay-for-play inducements must be eliminated before its insatiable demand for resources dries up support for non-revenue sports. otherwise, a crucial american asset will be lost. it is the policy of my administration that all college sports should be preserved and, where possible, expanded. my administration will therefore provide the stability, fairness, and balance necessary to protect student athletes, collegiate athletic scholarships and opportunities, and the special american institution of college sports. it is common sense that college sports are not, and should not be, professional sports, and my administration will take action accordingly. sec. 2. protecting and expanding women’s and non-revenue sports and prohibiting third-party pay-for-play payments. (a) it is the policy of the executive branch that opportunities for scholarships and collegiate athletic competition in women’s and non-revenue sports must be preserved and, where possible, expanded, including specifically as follows with respect to the 2025–2026 athletic season and future athletic seasons: (i) collegiate athletic departments with greater than $125,000,000 in rev enue during the 2024–2025 athletic season should provide more scholar ship opportunities in non-revenue sports than during the 2024–2025 ath letic season and should provide the maximum number of roster spots for non-revenue sports permitted under the applicable collegiate athletic rules; (ii) college athletic departments with greater than $50,000,000 in revenue during the 2024–2025 athletic season should provide at least as many scholarship opportunities in non-revenue sports as provided during the 2024–2025 athletic season and should provide the maximum number of roster spots for non-revenue sports permitted under the applicable collekhammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc2 giate athletic rules; and (iii) college athletic departments with $50,000,000 or less in revenue during the 2024–2025 athletic season or that do not have any revenue-generating sports should not disproportionately reduce scholarship opportunities or roster spots for sports based on the revenue that the sport generates. (b) it is the policy of the executive branch that any revenue-sharing per mitted between universities and collegiate athletes should be designed and implemented in a manner that preserves or expands scholarships and colle giate athletic opportunities in women’s and non-revenue sports. (c) to preserve the critical educational and developmental benefits of collegiate athletics for our nation, it is the policy of the executive branch that third-party, pay-for-play payments to collegiate athletes are improper and should not be permitted by universities. this policy does not apply to compensation provided to an athlete for the fair market value that the athlete provides to a third party, such as for a brand endorsement. (d) within 30 days of the date of this order, the secretary of education, in consultation with the attorney general, the secretary of health and human services, the secretary of education, and the chairman of the federal trade commission, shall develop a plan to advance the policies set forth in subsections (a)–(c) of this section through all available and appropriate regulatory, enforcement, and litigation mechanisms, including federal fund ing decisions, enforcement of title ix of the education amendments act of 1972, prohibiting unconstitutional actions by states to regulate interstate commerce, and enforcement of other constitutional and statutory protections, and by working with the congress and state governments, as appropriate. sec. 3. student-athlete status. the secretary of labor and the national labor relations board shall determine and implement the appropriate meas ures with respect to clarifying the status of collegiate athletes, including through guidance, rules, or other appropriate actions, that will maximize the educational benefits and opportunities provided by higher education institutions through athletics. sec. 4. legal protections for college athletics from lawsuits. (a) the attorney general and the chairman of the federal trade commission shall work to stabilize and preserve college athletics through litigation, guidelines, poli cies, or other actions, as appropriate, by protecting the rights and interests of student-athletes and the long-term availability of collegiate athletic scholar ships and opportunities when such elements are unreasonably challenged under antitrust or other legal theories. (b) within 60 days of the date of this order, to advance the purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the attorney general and the chairman of the federal trade commission shall: (i) review, and as necessary revise, litigation positions, guidelines, policies, or other actions; and (ii) develop a plan to implement appropriate future litigation positions, guidelines, policies, or other actions. sec. 5. protecting development of the united states olympic team. the assistant to the president for domestic policy and the director of the white house office of public liaison shall consult the united states olympic and paralympic committee and other appropriate organizations of american athletes about safeguarding the integral role and competitive advantage that american collegiate athletics provide in developing athletes to represent our nation in international athletic competitions. sec. 6. general provisions. (a) nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the director of the office of management and budget khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc2 relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) this order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) this order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the united states, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. 35824 federal register / vol. 90, no. 143 / tuesday, july 29, 2025 / presidential documents (d) the costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the department of education. the white house, july 24, 2025.

14319,07/28/2025,Preventing Woke AI in the Federal Government,"presidential documents executive order 14319 of july 23, 2025 preventing woke ai in the federal government by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. artificial intelligence (ai) will play a critical role in how americans of all ages learn new skills, consume information, and navigate their daily lives. americans will require reliable outputs from ai, but when ideological biases or social agendas are built into ai models, they can distort the quality and accuracy of the output. one of the most pervasive and destructive of these ideologies is so-called ‘‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’’ (dei). in the ai context, dei includes the suppression or distortion of factual information about race or sex; manipu lation of racial or sexual representation in model outputs; incorporation of concepts like critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism; and discrimination on the basis of race or sex. dei displaces the commitment to truth in favor of preferred outcomes and, as recent history illustrates, poses an existential threat to reliable ai. for example, one major ai model changed the race or sex of historical figures—including the pope, the founding fathers, and vikings—when prompted for images because it was trained to prioritize dei requirements at the cost of accuracy. another ai model refused to produce images cele brating the achievements of white people, even while complying with the same request for people of other races. in yet another case, an ai model asserted that a user should not ‘‘misgender’’ another person even if necessary to stop a nuclear apocalypse. while the federal government should be hesitant to regulate the functionality of ai models in the private marketplace, in the context of federal procure ment, it has the obligation not to procure models that sacrifice truthfulness and accuracy to ideological agendas. building on executive order 13960 of december 3, 2020 (promoting the use of trustworthy artificial intelligence in the federal government), this order helps fulfill that obligation in the context of large language models. sec. 2. definitions. for purposes of this order: (a) the term ‘‘agency’’ means an executive department, a military depart ment, or any independent establishment within the meaning of 5 u.s.c. 101, 102, and 104(1), respectively, and any wholly owned government cor poration within the meaning of 31 u.s.c. 9101.

14300,05/29/2025,Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,"presidential documents executive order 14300 of may 23, 2025 ordering the reform of the nuclear regulatory commission by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. abundant energy is a vital national- and economic security interest. in conjunction with domestic fossil fuel production, nuclear energy can liberate america from dependence on geopolitical rivals. it can power not only traditional manufacturing industries but also cutting-edge, energy-intensive industries such as artificial intelligence and quantum com puting. between 1954 and 1978, the united states authorized the construction of 133 since-completed civilian nuclear reactors at 81 power plants. since 1978, the nuclear regulatory commission (nrc) has authorized only a frac tion of that number; of these, only two reactors have entered into commercial operation. the nrc charges applicants by the hour to process license applica tions, with prolonged timelines that maximize fees while throttling nuclear power development. the nrc has failed to license new reactors even as technological advances promise to make nuclear power safer, cheaper, more adaptable, and more abundant than ever. this failure stems from a fundamental error: instead of efficiently promoting safe, abundant nuclear energy, the nrc has instead tried to insulate ameri cans from the most remote risks without appropriate regard for the severe domestic and geopolitical costs of such risk aversion. the nrc utilizes safety models that posit there is no safe threshold of radiation exposure and that harm is directly proportional to the amount of exposure. those models lack sound scientific basis and produce irrational results, such as requiring that nuclear plants protect against radiation below naturally occur ring levels. a myopic policy of minimizing even trivial risks ignores the reality that substitute forms of energy production also carry risk, such as pollution with potentially deleterious health effects. recent events in europe, such as the nationwide blackouts in spain and portugal, underscore the importance of my administration’s focus on dispatchable power generation—including nuclear power—over intermittent power. beginning today, my administration will reform the nrc, including its structure, personnel, regulations, and basic operations. in so doing, we will produce lasting american dominance in the global nuclear energy mar ket, create tens of thousands of high-paying jobs, and generate american led prosperity and resilience. sec. 2. policy. it is the policy of the united states to: (a) reestablish the united states as the global leader in nuclear energy; (b) facilitate increased deployment of new nuclear reactor technologies, such as generation iii+ and iv reactors, modular reactors, and microreactors, including by lowering regulatory and cost barriers to entry; (c) facilitate the expansion of american nuclear energy capacity from approximately 100 gw in 2024 to 400 gw by 2050; (d) employ emerging technologies to safely accelerate the modeling, simula tion, testing, and approval of new reactor designs; 22588 federal register / vol. 90, no. 102 / thursday, may 29, 2025 / presidential documents (e) support the continued operation of, and facilitate appropriate oper ational extensions for, the current nuclear fleet, as well as the reactivation of prematurely shuttered or partially completed nuclear facilities; and (f) maintain the united states’ leading reputation for nuclear safety. sec. 3. reforming the nrc’s culture. the congress has mandated that the nrc’s ‘‘licensing and regulation of the civilian use of radioactive materials and nuclear energy be conducted in a manner that is efficient and does not unnecessarily limit—(1) the civilian use of radioactive materials and deployment of nuclear energy; or (2) the benefits of civilian use of radioactive materials and nuclear energy technology to society.’’ accelerating deploy ment of versatile, advanced nuclear for clean energy act of 2024, public law 118–67, sec. 501(a). just as the congress directed, the nrc’s mission shall include facilitating nuclear power while ensuring reactor safety. when carrying out its licensing and related regulatory functions, the nrc shall consider the benefits of increased availability of, and innovation in, nuclear power to our economic and national security in addition to safety, health, and environmental considerations. sec. 4. reforming the nrc’s structure. (a) the current structure and staffing of the nrc are misaligned with the congress’s directive that the nrc shall not unduly restrict the benefits of nuclear power. the nrc shall, in consulta tion with the nrc’s doge team (as defined in executive order 14158 of january 20, 2025 (establishing and implementing the president’s ‘‘depart ment of government efficiency’’)), and consistent with its governing statutes, reorganize the nrc to promote the expeditious processing of license applica tions and the adoption of innovative technology. the nrc shall undertake reductions in force in conjunction with this reorganization, though certain functions may increase in size consistent with the policies in this order, including those devoted to new reactor licensing. the nrc shall also create a dedicated team of at least 20 officials to draft the new regulations directed by section 5 of this order. (b) the personnel and functions of the advisory committee on reactor safeguards (acrs) shall be reduced to the minimum necessary to fulfill acrs’s statutory obligations. review by acrs of permitting and licensing issues shall focus on issues that are truly novel or noteworthy. sec. 5. reforming and modernizing the nrc’s regulations. the nrc, working with its doge team, the office of management and budget, and other executive departments and agencies as appropriate, shall undertake a review and wholesale revision of its regulations and guidance documents, and issue notice(s) of proposed rulemaking effecting this revision within 9 months of the date of this order. the nrc shall issue final rules and guidance to conclude this revision process within 18 months of the date of this order. in conducting this wholesale revision, the nrc shall be guided by the policies set forth in section 2 of this order and shall in particular: (a) establish fixed deadlines for its evaluation and approval of licenses, license amendments, license renewals, certificates of compliance, power uprates, license transfers, and any other activity requested by a licensee or potential licensee, as directed under the nuclear energy innovation and modernization act, rather than the nonbinding ‘‘generic milestone schedules’’ guidelines the nrc has already adopted. those deadlines shall be enforced by fixed caps on the nrc’s recovery of hourly fees. the deadlines shall include: (1) a deadline of no more than 18 months for final decision on an application to construct and operate a new reactor of any type, com mencing with the first required step in the regulatory process, and (2) a deadline of no more than 1 year for final decision on an application to continue operating an existing reactor of any type, commencing with the first required step in the regulatory process. the regulations should not provide for tolling those deadlines except in instances of applicant failure, and must allow a reasonably diligent applicant to navigate the licens ing process successfully in the time allotted. moreover, these are maximum time periods; the nrc shall adopt shorter deadlines tailored to particular reactor types or licensing pathways as appropriate. (b) adopt science-based radiation limits. in particular, the nrc shall recon sider reliance on the linear no-threshold (lnt) model for radiation exposure and the ‘‘as low as reasonably achievable’’ standard, which is predicated on lnt. those models are flawed, as discussed in section 1 of this order. in reconsidering those limits, the nrc shall specifically consider adopting determinate radiation limits, and in doing so shall consult with the depart ment of defense (dod), the department of energy (doe), and the environ mental protection agency. (c) revise, in consultation with the council on environmental quality, nrc regulations governing nrc’s compliance with the national environ mental policy act to reflect the congress’s 2023 amendments to that statute and the policies articulated in sections 2 and 5 of executive order 14154 of january 20, 2025 (unleashing american energy). (d) establish an expedited pathway to approve reactor designs that the dod or the doe have tested and that have demonstrated the ability to function safely. nrc review of such designs shall focus solely on risks that may arise from new applications permitted by nrc licensure, rather than revisiting risks that have already been addressed in the doe or dod processes. (e) establish a process for high-volume licensing of microreactors and modular reactors, including by allowing for standardized applications and approvals and by considering to what extent such reactors or components thereof should be regulated through general licenses. (f) establish stringent thresholds for circumstances in which the nrc may demand changes to reactor design once construction is underway. (g) revise the reactor oversight process and reactor security rules and requirements to reduce unnecessary burdens and be responsive to credible risks. (h) adopt revised and, where feasible, determinate and data-backed thresh olds to ensure that reactor safety assessments focus on credible, realistic risks. (i) reconsider the regulations governing the time period for which a re newed license remains effective, and extend that period as appropriate based on available technological and safety data. (j) streamline the public hearings process. sec. 6. general provisions. (a) nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the director of the office of management and budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) this order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) this order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the united states, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. 22590 federal register / vol. 90, no. 102 / thursday, may 29, 2025 / presidential documents (d) the nuclear regulatory commission shall provide funding for publica tion of this order in the federal register. the white house, may 23, 2025.

14301,05/29/2025,Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy,"presidential documents executive order 14301 of may 23, 2025 reforming nuclear reactor testing at the department of energy by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. the united states led the development of civilian nuclear power through the atomic energy commission, the national reactor testing station (now known as idaho national laboratory), and several other federal government entities. this work produced safe and abundant energy. but in the decades since, commercial deployment of new nuclear technologies has all but stopped. the idaho national laboratory has principal responsi bility for constructing and testing new reactor designs; it concluded construc tion of new reactors in the 1970s. our proud history of innovation has succumbed to overregulated complacency. as i stated in executive order 14156 of january 20, 2025 (declaring a national energy emergency), the united states needs a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive development of advanced tech nologies, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain modern life and national security. nuclear energy both is vital to this effort and has never held so much promise. decades of research and engineering have produced prototypes of advanced nuclear technologies that incorporate passive safety mechanisms, improve the physical architecture of reactor designs, increase reactor operational flexibility and performance, and reduce risk in fuel disposal. advanced reactors—including microreactors, small modular reactors, and generation iv and generation iii+ reactors— have revolutionary potential. they will open a range of new applications to support data centers, microchip manufacturing, petrochemical production, healthcare, desalination, hydrogen production, and other industries. the united states cultivated the effort to design and build the first generation iv reactor for commercial use, but the federal government has effectively throttled the domestic deployment of advanced reactors, ceding the initiative to foreign nations in building this critical technology. that changes today. it is the policy of my administration to foster nuclear innovation and bring advanced nuclear technologies into domestic production as soon as possible. sec. 2. definitions. for purposes of this order: (a) the term ‘‘advanced reactor’’ has the same meaning as the term ‘‘ad vanced nuclear reactor’’ in 42 u.s.c. 16271(b)(1). (b) the term ‘‘department’’ means the department of energy. (c) the term ‘‘qualified test reactor’’ means an advanced reactor that satisfies thresholds established by the department sufficient to demonstrate that, from the perspective of technical development and financial backing, the reactor may feasibly be operational within 2 years from the date a substantially complete application is submitted. (d) the term ‘‘secretary’’ means the secretary of energy. sec. 3. findings. with some rare and arguable exceptions, no advanced reactors have yet been deployed in america. i find that design, construction, operation, and disposition of such reactors under the auspices of the depart ment—and not to produce commercial electric power—would be for research 22592 federal register / vol. 90, no. 102 / thursday, may 29, 2025 / presidential documents purposes, rather than ‘‘for the purpose of demonstrating the suitability for commercial application of . . . a reactor’’ within the meaning of 42 u.s.c. 5842. the purpose of testing these reactors at this stage in america’s indus trial evolution is to establish fundamental technological viability. thus, at least for the foreseeable future, advanced reactors over which the department exercises sufficient control and that do not produce commercial electric power, including those ‘‘under contract with and for the account of the [department],’’ 42 u.s.c. 2140(a)(2), fall within the jurisdiction of the depart ment, which has authority to foster research and development in nuclear reactors. nothing in this section alters the authority or jurisdiction of the department of defense. sec. 4. reforming the national laboratory process for reactor testing. (a) within 60 days of the date of this order, the secretary shall issue guidance regarding what counts as a qualified test reactor for purposes of this order. (b) within 90 days of the date of this order, the secretary shall take appropriate action to revise the regulations, guidance, and procedures and practices of the department, the national laboratories, and any other entity under the department’s jurisdiction to significantly expedite the review, approval, and deployment of advanced reactors under the department’s juris diction. the secretary shall ensure that the department’s expedited proce dures enable qualified test reactors to be safely operational at department owned or department-controlled facilities within 2 years following the sub mission of a substantially complete application. (c) upon finding that an applicant has submitted a substantially complete application for a qualified test reactor, the secretary shall establish a team consisting of representatives from the secretary’s office, the relevant national laboratory or laboratories, the department’s office of general counsel, and any other entities within the department that possess the authority to deconflict, oppose, or approve the application. the team shall provide assist ance to the applicant to ensure expeditious processing of its application. for these purposes, each member shall report directly to the secretary. (d) the secretary shall prioritize qualified test reactor projects for proc essing, as consistent with applicable law. sec. 5. establishing a pilot program outside the national laboratories. (a) the secretary shall create a pilot program for reactor construction and operation outside the national laboratories, pursuant to the atomic energy act’s authorization of reactors under the department’s sufficient control, including reactors ‘‘under contract with and for the account of’’ the depart ment, in accordance with 42 u.s.c. 2140. the secretary shall approve at least three reactors pursuant to this pilot program with the goal of achieving criticality in each of the three reactors by july 4, 2026. (b) upon approval of an application for this pilot program, the secretary shall assign a team to provide assistance to the applicant as specified in subsection 4(c) of this order. sec. 6. streamlining environmental reviews. (a) the secretary shall, in consultation with the chair of the council on environmental quality, take action to reform the department’s rules governing compliance with the na tional environmental policy act (nepa) no later than june 30, 2025, con sistent with the policies articulated in sections 2 and 5 of executive order 14154 of january 20, 2025 (unleashing american energy), and with applicable law. (b) the secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, use all available authorities to eliminate or expedite the department’s environmental reviews for authorizations, permits, approvals, leases, and any other activity requested by an applicant or potential applicant. in addition to the measures outlined in section 7 of the executive order of may 23, 2025 (deploying advanced nuclear reactor technologies for national security), such measures shall include determining which department functions are not subject to nepa, creating categorical exclusions as appropriate for reactors within certain parameters (or relying on existing categorical exclusions), relying on supple mental analyses where reactors will be located on existing sites, or utilizing alternative procedures under nepa. sec. 7. implementation. the secretary shall work with the doge team lead at the department, as defined in executive order 14158 of january 20, 2025 (establishing and implementing the president’s ‘‘department of government efficiency’’), with the director of the office of management and budget, and with the director of the office of science and technology policy to implement this order. sec. 8. general provisions.

14302,05/29/2025,Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base,"presidential documents executive order 14302 of may 23, 2025 reinvigorating the nuclear industrial base by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. the united states originally pioneered nuclear energy technology during a time of great peril. we now face a new set of challenges, including a global race to dominate in artificial intelligence, a growing need for energy independence, and access to uninterruptible power supplies for national security. it took nearly 40 years for the united states to add the same amount of nuclear capacity as another developed nation added in 10 years. further, as american deployment of advanced reactor designs has waned, 87 percent of nuclear reactors installed worldwide since 2017 are based on designs from two foreign countries. at the same time, the nation’s nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure has severely atrophied, leaving the united states heavily dependent on foreign sources of uranium as well as uranium enrichment and conversion services. these trends cannot continue. swift and decisive action is required to jumpstart america’s nuclear energy industrial base and ensure our national and economic security by increasing fuel availability and production, securing civil nuclear supply chains, im proving the efficiency with which advanced nuclear reactors are licensed, and preparing our workforce to establish america’s energy dominance and accelerate our path towards a more secure and independent energy future. sec. 2. policy. it is the policy of the united states to expedite and promote to the fullest possible extent the production and operation of nuclear energy to provide affordable, reliable, safe, and secure energy to the american people, to power advanced nuclear reactor technologies, as defined in 42 u.s.c. 16271(b)(1)(a), and to build associated supply chains that secure our global industrial and digital dominance, achieve our energy independ ence, protect our national security, and maximize the efficiency and effective ness of nuclear fuel through recycling, reprocessing, and reinvigorating the commercial sector. sec. 3. strengthening the domestic nuclear fuel cycle. (a) within 240 days of the date of this order, the secretary of energy, in coordination with the secretary of defense, the secretary of transportation, and the director of the office of management and budget (omb), shall prepare and submit to the president, through the chair of the national energy dominance council and the director of the office of science and technology policy, a report that includes: (i) a recommended national policy to support the management of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste and the development and deployment of advanced fuel cycle capabilities to establish a safe, secure, and sustain able long-term fuel cycle; (ii) a review of relevant statutory authorities to identify any legislative changes necessary or desirable to achieve the national policy recommended under subsection (a)(i) of this section; (iii) an evaluation of the reprocessing and recycling of spent nuclear fuel from the operation of department of defense and department of energy reactors and other spent nuclear fuel managed by the department of energy, along with a discussion of steps the department of defense 22596 federal register / vol. 90, no. 102 / thursday, may 29, 2025 / presidential documents and the department of energy are taking or must take to improve such reprocessing and recycling processes; (iv) an analysis of legal, budgetary, and policy considerations relevant to efficiently transferring spent nuclear fuel from reactors to a government owned, privately operated reprocessing and recycling facility; (v) recommendations for the efficient use of the uranium, plutonium, and other products recovered through recycling and reprocessing; (vi) recommendations for the efficient disposal of the wastes generated by recycling or reprocessing through a permanent disposal pathway; (vii) a recommended process for evaluating, prior to disposal, nuclear waste materials for isotopes of value to national security, or medical, industrial, and scientific sectors; (viii) a reevaluation of historic and current nuclear reprocessing, separation, and storage facilities slated for decommissioning and that are identified as having valuable materials, isotopes, equipment, licenses, operations, or experienced workers, and that may have potential fuel cycle or national security benefits if operations are continued or increased; and (ix) a program to develop methods and technologies to transport, domesti cally and overseas, used and unused advanced nuclear fuels and advanced nuclear reactors containing such fuels in a safe, secure, and environ mentally sound manner, including any legislation required to support this initiative. (b) within 120 days of the date of this order, the secretary of energy, in consultation with the chair of the nuclear regulatory commission and the director of omb, shall develop a plan to expand domestic uranium conversion capacity and expand enrichment capabilities sufficient to meet projected civilian and defense reactor needs for low enriched uranium (leu), high enriched uranium (heu) and high assay, low enriched uranium (haleu), subject to retention of such stockpiles as are necessary for tritium production, naval propulsion, and nuclear weapons. the plan shall be imple mented based on the timeframes set forth in the plan. (c) the secretary of energy shall halt the surplus plutonium dilute and dispose program except with respect to the department of energy’s legal obligations to the state of south carolina. in place of this program, the secretary of energy shall establish a program to dispose of surplus plutonium by processing and making it available to industry in a form that can be utilized for the fabrication of fuel for advanced nuclear technologies. (d) within 90 days of the date of this order, the secretary of energy, in consultation with the secretary of defense as appropriate, shall update the department of energy’s excess uranium management policy to align with the policy objectives of this order and the nuclear fuel security act, factoring in the national security need to modernize the united states nuclear weapon stockpile. the secretary of energy shall prioritize contracting for the development of fuel fabrication facilities that demonstrate the technical and financial feasibility to supply fuel to qualified test reactors or pilot program reactors within 3 years from the date of such applications. (e) within 30 days of the date of this order, the secretary of energy, in coordination with the attorney general and the chairman of the federal trade commission, shall utilize the authority provided to the president in section 708(c)(1) of the defense production act of 1950 (dpa) (50 u.s.c. 4558(c)(1)), which has been delegated to the secretary of energy pursuant to executive order 13603 of march 16, 2012 (national defense resources preparedness), to seek voluntary agreements pursuant to section 708 of the dpa with domestic nuclear energy companies. the secretary of energy should prioritize agreements with those companies that have achieved objec tive milestones (e.g., department of energy-approved conceptual safety design reports, the ability to privately finance their fuel, or the demonstrated tech nology capability) for the cooperative procurement of leu and haleu, including as needed by the federal government for tritium production, naval propulsion, and nuclear weapons. (f) the secretary of energy, the attorney general, and the chairman of the federal trade commission shall take all necessary and appropriate steps under sections 708(c), (d), (e), and (f)(1)(a) of the dpa (50 u.s.c. 4558(c), (d), (e), (f)(1)(a)), for the secretary of energy to form agreements pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. (g) the attorney general shall, after consultation with the chairman of the federal trade commission, consider whether to make the finding de scribed in section 708(f)(1)(b) of the dpa (50 u.s.c. 4558(f)(1)(b)), with respect to any agreement and, no later than 30 days after any voluntary agreement is reached, shall publish such finding as appropriate. (h) such voluntary agreements shall further allow consultation with domes tic nuclear energy companies to discuss and implement methods to enhance the capability to manage spent nuclear fuel, including the recycling and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, to ensure the continued reliable operation of the nation’s nuclear reactors. such voluntary agreements shall also allow industry consultation to establish consortia and plans of action to ensure that the nuclear fuel supply chain capacity, including milling, conversion, enrichment, deconversion, fabrication, recycling, or reprocessing, is available to enable the continued reliable operation of the nation’s existing, and future, nuclear reactors. the secretary of energy, consistent with applicable law, is authorized to provide procurement support, forward contracts, or guarantees to such consortia as a means to ensure offtake for newly estab lished domestic fuel supply, including conversion, enrichment, reprocessing, or fabrication capacity. sec. 4. funding for restart, completion, uprate, or construction of nuclear plants. (a) to maximize the speed and scale of new nuclear capacity, the department of energy shall prioritize work with the nuclear energy industry to facilitate 5 gigawatt of power uprates to existing nuclear reactors and have 10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030. to help achieve these objectives, the secretary of energy, through the department of energy loan programs office, shall, subject to the require ments of the federal credit reform act and other applicable law and omb circular a–11, prioritize activities that support nuclear energy, including actions to make available resources for restarting closed nuclear power plants, increasing power output of operating nuclear power plants, completing con struction of nuclear reactors that was prematurely suspended, constructing new advanced nuclear reactors, and improving all associated aspects of the nuclear fuel supply chain. (b) the secretary of energy shall also coordinate with the secretary of defense to assess the feasibility of restarting or repurposing closed nuclear power plants as energy hubs for military microgrid support, consistent with applicable law, focusing initially on installations with insufficient power resilience or grid fragility. (c) within 180 days of the date of this order, the secretary of energy, in coordination with the administrator of the small business administration, shall, subject to the availability of appropriations, prioritize funding for qualified advanced nuclear technologies through grants, loans, investment capital, funding opportunities, and other federal support. priority shall be given to those companies demonstrating the largest degrees of design and technological maturity, financial backing, and potential for near-term deploy ment of their technologies. sec. 5. expanding the nuclear energy workforce. (a) nuclear engineering and other careers and education pathways that support the nuclear energy industry shall be considered areas of focus and priority pursuant to executive order 14278 of april 23, 2025 (preparing americans for high-paying skilled trade jobs of the future).

14303,05/29/2025,Restoring Gold Standard Science,"presidential documents executive order 14303 of may 23, 2025 restoring gold standard science by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, including section 7301 of title 5, united states code, it is hereby ordered: section 1. policy and purpose. over the last 5 years, confidence that scientists act in the best interests of the public has fallen significantly. a majority of researchers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics believe science is facing a reproducibility crisis. the falsification of data by leading researchers has led to high-profile retractions of federally funded research. unfortunately, the federal government has contributed to this loss of trust. in several notable cases, executive departments and agencies (agencies) have used or promoted scientific information in a highly misleading manner. for example, under the prior administration, the centers for disease control and prevention issued covid–19 guidance on reopening schools that incor porated edits by the american federation of teachers and was understood to discourage in-person learning. this guidance’s restrictive and burdensome reopening conditions led many schools to remain at least partially closed, resulting in substantial negative effects on educational outcomes—even though the best available scientific evidence showed that children were unlikely to transmit or suffer serious illness or death from the virus, and that opening schools with reasonable mitigation measures would have only minor effects on transmission. the national marine fisheries service justified a biological opinion by adopt ing an admitted ‘‘worst-case scenario’’ projection of the north atlantic right whale population that it believed was ‘‘very likely’’ wrong. the agency’s proposed actions could have destroyed the historic maine lobster fishery. the d.c. circuit court of appeals subsequently overturned that opinion because the agency’s decision to seek out the worst-case scenario skewed its approach to the evidence. similarly, agencies have used representative concentration pathway (rcp) scenario 8.5 to assess the potential effects of climate change in a ‘‘higher’’ warming scenario. rcp 8.5 is a worst-case scenario based on highly unlikely assumptions like end-of-century coal use exceeding estimates of recoverable coal reserves. scientists have warned that presenting rcp 8.5 as a likely outcome is misleading. actions taken by the prior administration further politicized science, for example, by encouraging agencies to incorporate diversity, equity, and inclu sion considerations into all aspects of science planning, execution, and communication. scientific integrity in the production and use of science by the federal government is critical to maintaining the trust of the american people and ensuring confidence in government decisions informed by science. my administration is committed to restoring a gold standard for science to ensure that federally funded research is transparent, rigorous, and impactful, and that federal decisions are informed by the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available. we must restore the american people’s faith in the scientific enterprise and institutions that create and apply scientific knowledge in service of the public good. repro ducibility, rigor, and unbiased peer review must be maintained. this order restores the scientific integrity policies of my first administration and ensures 22602 federal register / vol. 90, no. 102 / thursday, may 29, 2025 / presidential documents that agencies practice data transparency, acknowledge relevant scientific uncertainties, are transparent about the assumptions and likelihood of sce narios used, approach scientific findings objectively, and communicate sci entific data accurately. agency use of gold standard science, as set forth in this order, will spur innovation, translate discovery to success, and ensure continued american strength and global leadership in technology. sec. 2. definitions. for the purposes of this order: (a) ‘‘employee’’ has the meaning given that term in 5 u.s.c. 2105. (b) ‘‘scientific information’’ means factual inputs, data, models, analyses, technical information, or scientific assessments related to such disciplines as the behavioral and social sciences, public health and medical sciences, life and earth sciences, engineering, physical sciences, or probability and statistics. this includes any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data, in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual forms. (c) ‘‘scientific misconduct’’ means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, reviewing, or reporting the results of scientific research, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion. for the purposes of this definition: (i) ‘‘fabrication’’ is making up data or results and recording or reporting them; (ii) ‘‘falsification’’ is manipulating research materials, equipment, or proc esses, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record; and (iii) ‘‘plagiarism’’ is the appropriation of another person’s ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit. (d) ‘‘senior appointee’’ means an individual appointed by the president (or an individual performing the functions and duties of an individual appointed by the president) or a non-career member of the senior executive service. (e) ‘‘weight of scientific evidence’’ means an approach to scientific evalua tion in which each piece of relevant information is considered based on its quality and relevance, and then transparently integrated with other rel evant information to inform the scientific evaluation prior to making a judgment about the scientific evaluation. quality and relevance determina tions, at a minimum, should include consideration of study design, fitness for purpose, replicability, peer review, and transparency and reliability of data. sec. 3. restoring gold standard science. (a) within 30 days of the date of this order, the director of the office of science and technology policy (ostp director) shall, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies, issue guidance for agencies on implementation of ‘‘gold standard science’’ in the conduct and management of their respective scientific activities. for the purposes of this order, gold standard science means science conducted in a manner that is: (i) reproducible; (ii) transparent; (iii) communicative of error and uncertainty; (iv) collaborative and interdisciplinary; (v) skeptical of its findings and assumptions; (vi) structured for falsifiability of hypotheses; (vii) subject to unbiased peer review; (viii) accepting of negative results as positive outcomes; and (ix) without conflicts of interest. (b) upon publication of the guidance prescribed in subsection (a), each agency head, as necessary and appropriate and in consultation with the director of the office of management and budget (omb director) and the ostp director, shall promptly update applicable agency policies governing the production and use of scientific information, including scientific integrity policies, to implement the ostp director’s guidance on gold standard science and ensure that agency scientific activities are conducted in accord ance with this order. (c) each agency head shall, to the extent practicable, incorporate the ostp director’s guidance on gold standard science and the requirements of this order into the processes by which their agency conducts, manages, interprets, communicates, and uses scientific or technological information prior to the finalization of the updated policies under this section. (d) within 60 days of the publication of the guidance prescribed in section 3(a), agency heads shall report to the ostp director on the actions taken to implement gold standard science at their agency. sec. 4. improving the use, interpretation, and communication of scientific data. no later than 30 days after the date of this order, agency heads and employees shall adhere to the following rules governing the use, interpre tation, and communication of scientific data, unless otherwise provided by law: (a) employees shall not engage in scientific misconduct nor knowingly rely on information resulting from scientific misconduct. (b) except as prohibited by law, and consistent with relevant policies that protect national security or sensitive personal or confidential business information, agency heads shall in a timely manner and, to the extent practicable and within the agency’s authority: (i) subject to paragraph (ii), make publicly available the following informa tion within the agency’s possession: (a) the data, analyses, and conclusions associated with scientific and technological information produced or used by the agency that the agency reasonably assesses will have a clear and substantial effect on important public policies or important private sector decisions (influential scientific information), including data cited in peer-reviewed literature; and (b) the models and analyses (including, as applicable, the source code for such models) the agency used to generate such influential scientific information. employees may not invoke exemption 5 to the freedom of information act (5 u.s.c. 552(b)(5)) to prevent disclosure of such models unless authorized in writing to do so by the agency head following prior notice to the ostp director. (ii) risk models used to guide agency enforcement actions or select enforce ment targets are not information that must be disclosed under this sub section. (c) when using scientific information in agency decision-making, employ ees shall transparently acknowledge and document uncertainties, including how uncertainty propagates throughout any models used in the analysis. (d) where employees produce or use scientific information to inform policy or legal determinations they must use science that comports with the legal standards applicable to those determinations, including when agen cies evaluate the realistic or reasonably foreseeable effects of an action. (e) employees shall be transparent about the likelihood of the assumptions and scenarios used. highly unlikely and overly precautionary assumptions and scenarios should only be relied upon in agency decision-making where required by law or otherwise pertinent to the agency’s action. (f) when scientific or technological information is used to inform agency evaluations and subsequent decision-making, employees shall apply a ‘‘weight of scientific evidence’’ approach. (g) employees’ communication of scientific information shall be consistent with the results of the relevant analysis and evaluation and, to the extent 22604 federal register / vol. 90, no. 102 / thursday, may 29, 2025 / presidential documents that uncertainty is present, the degree of uncertainty should be commu nicated. communications involving a scientific model or information derived from a scientific model should include reference to any material assumptions that inform the model’s outputs. (h) once the guidance on gold standard science is established and promul gated pursuant to section 3 of this order, it shall, among other things, form the basis for employees’ evaluation of all scientific and technological information called for in this order except where otherwise required by law. sec. 5. interim scientific integrity policies.

(b) if, following the action described in subsection (a) of this section, significant progress towards most-favored-nation pricing for american pa tients is not delivered, to the extent consistent with law: (i) the secretary shall propose a rulemaking plan to impose most-favored nation pricing; (ii) the secretary shall consider certification to the congress that importa tion under section 804(j) of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act (fdca) will pose no additional risk to the public’s health and safety and result in a significant reduction in the cost of prescription drugs to the american consumer; and if the secretary so certifies, then the commissioner of food and drugs shall take action under section 804(j)(2)(b) of the fdca to describe circumstances under which waivers will be consistently granted to import prescription drugs on a case-by case basis from developed nations with low-cost prescription drugs; (iii) following the report issued under section 13 of executive order 14273 of april 15, 2025 (lowering drug prices by once again putting americans first), the attorney general and the chairman of the federal trade com mission shall, to the extent consistent with law, undertake enforcement action against any anti-competitive practices identified within such report, including through use of sections 1 and 2 of the sherman antitrust act and section 5 of the federal trade commission act, as appropriate; (iv) the secretary of commerce, and the heads of other relevant agencies as necessary, shall review and consider all necessary action regarding the export of pharmaceutical drugs or precursor material that may be fueling the global price discrimination; (v) the commissioner of food and drugs shall review and potentially modify or revoke approvals granted for drugs, for those drugs that maybe be unsafe, ineffective, or improperly marketed; and (vi) the heads of agencies shall take all action available, in coordination with the assistant to the president for domestic policy, to address global freeloading and price discrimination against american patients. sec. 6. general provisions.

14294,05/14/2025,Fighting Overcriminalization in Federal Regulations,"presidential documents executive order 14294 of may 9, 2025 fighting overcriminalization in federal regulations by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. the united states is drastically overregulated. the code of federal regulations contains over 48,000 sections, stretching over 175,000 pages—far more than any citizen can possibly read, let alone fully under stand. worse, many carry potential criminal penalties for violations. the situation has become so dire that no one—likely including those charged with enforcing our criminal laws at the department of justice—knows how many separate criminal offenses are contained in the code of federal regula tions, with at least one source estimating hundreds of thousands of such crimes. many of these regulatory crimes are ‘‘strict liability’’ offenses, mean ing that citizens need not have a guilty mental state to be convicted of a crime. this status quo is absurd and unjust. it allows the executive branch to write the law, in addition to executing it. that situation can lend itself to abuse and weaponization by providing government officials tools to target unwitting individuals. it privileges large corporations, which can afford to hire expensive legal teams to navigate complex regulatory schemes and fence out new market entrants, over average americans. the purpose of this order is to ease the regulatory burden on everyday americans and ensure no american is transformed into a criminal for vio lating a regulation they have no reason to know exists. sec. 2. policy. it is the policy of the united states that: (a) criminal enforcement of criminal regulatory offenses is disfavored. (b) prosecution of criminal regulatory offenses is most appropriate for persons who know or can be presumed to know what is prohibited or required by the regulation and willingly choose not to comply, thereby causing or risking substantial public harm. prosecutions of criminal regu latory offenses should focus on matters where a putative defendant is alleged to have known his conduct was unlawful. (c) strict liability offenses are ‘‘generally disfavored.’’ united states v. united states gypsum, co., 438 u.s. 422, 438 (1978). where enforcement is appropriate, agencies should consider civil rather than criminal enforce ment of strict liability regulatory offenses or, if appropriate and consistent with due process and the right to jury trial, see jarkesy v. securities and exchange commission, 603 u.s. 109 (2024), administrative enforcement. (d) agencies promulgating regulations potentially subject to criminal en forcement should explicitly describe the conduct subject to criminal enforce ment, the authorizing statutes, and the mens rea standard applicable to those offenses. sec. 3. definitions. for purposes of this order: lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc3 (a) ‘‘agency’’ has the meaning given to ‘‘executive agency’’ in section 105 of title 5, united states code; (b) ‘‘criminal regulatory offense’’ means a federal regulation that is enforce able by a criminal penalty; and (c) ‘‘mens rea’’ means the state of mind that by law must be proven to convict a particular defendant of a particular crime. 20364 federal register / vol. 90, no. 92 / wednesday, may 14, 2025 / presidential documents sec. 4. report on criminal regulatory offenses. (a) within 365 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency, in consultation with the attorney general, shall provide to the director of the office of management and budget (omb) a report containing: (i) a list of all criminal regulatory offenses enforceable by the agency or the department of justice; and (ii) for each criminal regulatory offense identified in subsection (a)(i) of this section, the range of potential criminal penalties for a violation and the applicable mens rea standard for the criminal regulatory offense. (b) at the same time the head of each agency provides to the director of omb the report required by subsection (a) of this section, the agency head shall publicly post the report on its agency webpage. (c) the head of each agency shall periodically, but not less than once a year, update the report described in subsection (a) of this section. (d) criminal enforcement of any criminal regulatory offense not identified in the report described in subsection (a) of this section is strongly discour aged. the head of each agency shall consider whether a criminal regulatory offense is included in an agency’s public report when considering whether to make a criminal referral to the department of justice or, where applicable, to the agency’s inspector general. further, the attorney general shall con sider whether a criminal regulatory offense is included in an agency’s public report before initiating an investigation or initiating criminal proceedings for violating regulatory standards. sec. 5. promoting regulatory transparency. (a) following issuance of this order, all future notices of proposed rulemaking (nprms) and final rules published in the federal register, the violation of which may constitute criminal regulatory offenses, should include a statement identifying that the rule or proposed rule is a criminal regulatory offense and the authorizing statute. agencies should draft this statement in consultation with the depart ment of justice. (b) the regulatory text of all nprms and final rules with criminal con sequences published in the federal register after the date of this order should explicitly state a mens rea requirement for each element of a criminal regulatory offense, accompanied by citations to the relevant provisions of the authorizing statute. (c) strict liability criminal regulatory offenses are disfavored. any proposed or final criminal regulatory offense that includes a strict liability mens rea for the offense shall be treated as a ‘‘significant regulatory action’’ and submitted to the administrator of the office of information and regulatory affairs for the review applicable to significant regulatory actions under executive order 12866 of september 30, 1993 (regulatory planning and review), or any successor process. sec. 6. default mens rea for criminal regulatory offenses. (a) the head of each agency, in consultation with the attorney general, shall examine the agency’s statutory authorities and determine whether there is authority to adopt a background mens rea standard for criminal regulatory offenses that applies unless a specific regulation states an alternative mens rea. (b) within 30 days of the submission of the report described in section 4(a) of this order, the head of each agency, in consultation with the attorney general, shall submit a report to the director of omb summarizing the information submitted under section 4(a) of this order and assessing whether the applicable mens rea standards for criminal regulatory offenses enforced by the agency are appropriate. if consistent with the statutory authorities lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc3 identified pursuant to the review described in subsection (a) of this section, the report should present a plan for changing the applicable mens rea standards and adopting a generally applicable background mens rea standard, and provide a justification for each criminal regulatory offense for which the agency proposes to deviate from its default mens rea standard. sec. 7. agency referrals for potential criminal enforcement. within 45 days of the date of this order, and in consultation with the attorney general, each agency should publish guidance in the federal register describing its plan to address criminally liable regulatory offenses. each agency’s guid ance should make clear that when the agency is deciding whether to refer alleged violations of criminal regulatory offenses to the department of justice, the agency should consider factors such as: (a) the harm or risk of harm, pecuniary or otherwise, caused by the alleged offense; (b) the potential gain to the putative defendant that could result from the offense; (c) whether the putative defendant held specialized knowledge, expertise, or was licensed in an industry related to the rule or regulation at issue; and (d) evidence, if any is available, of the putative defendant’s general aware ness of the unlawfulness of his conduct as well as his knowledge or lack thereof of the regulation at issue. sec. 8. effect on immigration enforcement and national security functions. nothing in this order shall apply to the enforcement of the immigration laws or regulations promulgated to implement such laws, nor shall it apply to the enforcement of laws or regulations related to national security or defense. sec. 9. general provisions. (a) nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the director of the office of management and budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) this order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

14293,05/08/2025,Regulatory Relief To Promote Domestic Production of Critical Medicines,"presidential documents executive order 14293 of may 5, 2025 regulatory relief to promote domestic production of critical medicines by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. during my first term, my administration took unprece dented action to improve the well-being of the american people by restoring capacity for domestic production of critical pharmaceutical products. nota bly, in executive order 13944 of august 6, 2020 (combating public health emergencies and strengthening national security by ensuring essential medicines, medical countermeasures, and critical inputs are made in the united states), i directed each executive department and agency involved in the procurement of essential medicines, medical countermeasures, and critical inputs to take a variety of actions to increase their domestic procure ment of essential medicines, medical countermeasures, and critical inputs, as defined in section 7 of that order, and to identify vulnerabilities in our nation’s supply chains for these products. unfortunately, the prior ad ministration did too little to advance these goals. critical barriers and infor mation gaps persist in establishing a domestic, resilient, and affordable pharmaceutical supply chain for american patients. one key area of concern is the length of time it takes to build pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in the united states today. new construction must navigate myriad federal, state, and local requirements ranging from building standards and zoning restrictions to environmental protocols that together diminish the certainty needed to generate investment for large manufacturing projects. for pharmaceutical manufacturing, these barriers are heightened by unannounced inspections of domestic manufacturers by the food and drug administration (fda), which are more frequent than such inspections at international facilities. industry estimates suggest that building new manu facturing capacity for pharmaceuticals and critical inputs may take as long as 5 to 10 years, which is unacceptable from a national security standpoint. even expanding existing capacity or modifying existing production lines to produce new or different products requires extensive permitting and regulatory approval, making it more difficult to repurpose existing underuti lized pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity available domestically. it is in the best interest of the nation to eliminate regulatory barriers to the domestic production of the medicines americans need. my administra tion will work to make the united states the most competitive nation in the world for the manufacture of safe and effective pharmaceutical products. sec. 2. policy. it is the policy of the united states that the regulation of manufacturing pharmaceutical products and inputs be streamlined to facilitate the restoration of a robust domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing base. sec. 3. streamlining review of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing by the food and drug administration. within 180 days of the date of this order, the secretary of health and human services, through the commis sioner of food and drugs (fda commissioner), shall review existing regula tions and guidance that pertain to the development of domestic pharma ceutical manufacturing and shall take steps to eliminate any duplicative or unnecessary requirements in such regulations and guidance; maximize 19616 federal register / vol. 90, no. 88 / thursday, may 8, 2025 / presidential documents the timeliness and predictability of agency review; and streamline and accel erate the development of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing. the fda commissioner’s review shall encompass all regulations and guidance that apply to the inspection and approval of new and expanded manufacturing capacity, emerging technologies that enable the manufacturing of pharma ceutical products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, key starting materials, and associated raw materials in the united states. the fda commissioner shall: (a) evaluate the current risk-based approach to prior approval of licensure inspections, including when such inspections are necessary, and seek to improve upon this approach to ensure all required inspections are prompt, efficient, and limited to what is necessary to ensure compliance with the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act and other federal law;

14290,05/07/2025,Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,"presidential documents executive order 14290 of may 1, 2025 ending taxpayer subsidization of biased media by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. national public radio (npr) and the public broadcasting service (pbs) receive taxpayer funds through the corporation for public broadcasting (cpb). unlike in 1967, when the cpb was established, today the media landscape is filled with abundant, diverse, and innovative news options. government funding of news media in this environment is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence. at the very least, americans have the right to expect that if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting at all, they fund only fair, accurate, unbi ased, and nonpartisan news coverage. no media outlet has a constitutional right to taxpayer subsidies, and the government is entitled to determine which categories of activities to subsidize. the cpb’s governing statute re flects principles of impartiality: the cpb may not ‘‘contribute to or otherwise support any political party.’’ 47 u.s.c. 396(f)(3); see also id. 396(e)(2). the cpb fails to abide by these principles to the extent it subsidizes npr and pbs. which viewpoints npr and pbs promote does not matter. what does matter is that neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens. i therefore instruct the cpb board of directors (cpb board) and all executive departments and agencies (agencies) to cease federal funding for npr and pbs. sec. 2. instructions to the corporation for public broadcasting. (a) the cpb board shall cease direct funding to npr and pbs, consistent with my administration’s policy to ensure that federal funding does not support biased and partisan news coverage. the cpb board shall cancel existing direct funding to the maximum extent allowed by law and shall decline to provide future funding. (b) the cpb board shall cease indirect funding to npr and pbs, including by ensuring that licensees and permittees of public radio and television stations, as well as any other recipients of cpb funds, do not use federal funds for npr and pbs. to effectuate this directive, the cpb board shall, before june 30, 2025, revise the 2025 television community service grants general provisions and eligibility criteria and the 2025 radio community service grants general provisions and eligibility criteria to prohibit direct or indirect funding of npr and pbs. to the extent permitted by the 2024 television community service grants general provisions and eligibility cri teria, the 2024 radio community service grants general provisions and eligibility criteria, and applicable law, the cpb board shall also prohibit parties subject to these provisions from funding npr or pbs after the date khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc4 of this order. in addition, the cpb board shall take all other necessary steps to minimize or eliminate its indirect funding of npr and pbs. sec. 3. instructions to other agencies.

(b) after taking the actions specified in subsection (a) of this section, the heads of all agencies shall identify any remaining grants, contracts, 19416 federal register / vol. 90, no. 87 / wednesday, may 7, 2025 / presidential documents or other funding instruments entered into with npr or pbs and shall deter mine whether npr and pbs are in compliance with the terms of those instruments. in the event of a finding of noncompliance, the head of the relevant agency shall take appropriate steps under the terms of the instru ment.

14291,05/07/2025,Establishment of the Religious Liberty Commission,"presidential documents executive order 14291 of may 1, 2025 establishment of the religious liberty commission by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose and policy. it shall be the policy of the executive branch to vigorously enforce the historic and robust protections for religious liberty enshrined in federal law. the founders envisioned a nation in which religious voices and views are integral to a vibrant public square and human flourishing and in which religious people and institutions are free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or hostility from the government. indeed, the roots of religious liberty stretch back to the early settlers who fled religious persecution in europe, seeking a new world where they could choose, follow, and practice their faith without interference from the govern ment. the principle of religious liberty was enshrined in american law with the first amendment to the constitution in 1791. since that time, the constitution has protected the fundamental right to religious liberty as americans’ first freedom. during my first term, i issued executive order 13798 of may 4, 2017 (pro moting free speech and religious liberty). pursuant to that order, the attor ney general issued a memorandum for all executive departments and agen cies (agencies) titled ‘‘federal law protections for religious liberty’’ on october 6, 2017. the supreme court has also continued to vindicate the founders’ commitment to religious liberty, including by giving effect to the principle that religious voices should be welcomed on an equal basis in the public square. in recent years, some federal, state, and local policies have threatened america’s unique and beautiful tradition of religious liberty. these policies attempt to infringe upon longstanding conscience protections, prevent parents from sending their children to religious schools, threaten loss of funding or denial of non-profit tax status for faith-based entities, and single out religious groups and institutions for exclusion from governmental programs. some opponents of religious liberty would remove religion entirely from public life. others characterize religious liberty as inconsistent with civil rights, despite religions’ vital roles in the abolition of slavery; the passage of federal civil rights laws; and the provision of indispensable social, edu cational, and health services. president ronald reagan reminded us that ‘‘freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.’’ americans need to be reacquainted with our nation’s superb experiment in religious freedom in order to preserve it against emerging threats. therefore, the federal government will promote citizens’ pride in our foundational history, identify emerging threats to reli gious liberty, uphold federal laws that protect all citizens’ full participation in a pluralistic democracy, and protect the free exercise of religion. sec. 2. establishment of the religious liberty commission.

(iv) the commission shall advise the white house faith office and the domestic policy council on religious liberty policies of the united states. specific activities of the commission shall include, to the extent permitted by law, recommending steps to secure domestic religious liberty by execu tive or legislative actions as well as identifying opportunities for the white house faith office to partner with the ambassador at large for international religious freedom to further the cause of religious liberty around the world.

14287,05/02/2025,Protecting American Communities From Criminal Aliens,"presidential documents executive order 14287 of april 28, 2025 protecting american communities from criminal aliens by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose and policy. federal supremacy with respect to immigra tion, national security, and foreign policy is axiomatic. the constitution provides the federal government with plenary authority regarding immigra tion to protect the sovereignty of our nation and to conduct relations with other nations, who must be able to deal with one national government on such matters. this power is sometimes contained in specific constitutional provisions: article ii of the constitution vests the power to protect national security and conduct foreign policy in the president of the united states, and article iv, section 4, requires the federal government to ‘‘protect each of [the states] against invasion.’’ this federal power over immigration is also an inherent element of national sovereignty. the prior administration allowed unchecked millions of aliens to illegally enter the united states. the resulting public safety and national security risks are exacerbated by the presence of, and control of territory by, inter national cartels and other transnational criminal organizations along the southern border, as well as terrorists and other malign actors who intend to harm the united states and the american people. this invasion at the southern border requires the federal government to take measures to fulfill its obligation to the states. yet some state and local officials nevertheless continue to use their authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of federal immigration laws. this is a lawless insurrection against the supremacy of federal law and the federal government’s obligation to defend the territorial sovereignty of the united states. beyond the intolerable national security risks, such nullification efforts often violate federal criminal laws, including those pro hibiting obstruction of justice (18 u.s.c. 1501 et seq.), unlawfully harboring or hiring illegal aliens (8 u.s.c. 1324), conspiracy against the united states (18 u.s.c. 371), and conspiracy to impede federal law enforcement (18 u.s.c. 372). assisting aliens in violating federal immigration law could also violate the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act (18 u.s.c. 1961 et seq.). some measures to assist illegal aliens also necessarily violate federal laws prohibiting discrimination against americans in favor of illegal aliens and protecting americans’ civil rights. it is imperative that the federal government restore the enforcement of united states law. sec. 2. designation of ‘‘sanctuary’’ jurisdictions. (a) within 30 days of the date of this order, the attorney general, in coordination with the sec retary of homeland security, shall publish a list of states and local jurisdic tions that obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration laws (sanctuary jurisdictions). after this initial publication, the attorney general and the khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc2 secretary of homeland security shall update this list as necessary.

14284,04/29/2025,Strengthening Probationary Periods in the Federal Service,"17729 vol. 90, no. 81 tuesday, april 29, 2025 title 3— executive order 14284 of april 24, 2025 the president strengthening probationary periods in the federal service by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, including sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5, united states code, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. the american people deserve a federal workforce that is high-quality, efficient, dedicated to the public interest, and no larger than necessary. probationary periods (for employees in the competitive serv ice) and trial periods (for employees in the excepted service) have provided a longstanding critical tool to assess the fitness of newly hired federal employees before finalizing their appointments to federal service. the government accountability office has documented, however, that agen cies have not been using probationary and trial periods as effectively as they could to remove appointees whose continued employment is not in the public interest. as a result of this failure to remove poor performers, agencies have often retained and given tenure to underperforming employees who should have been screened out during their probationary period. conditions of good administration require that agency approval should be required before probationary employees become tenured federal employees. as the merit systems protection board recommended in its 2005 report the probationary period: a critical assessment opportunity, there should be ‘‘procedures so that a probationer does not automatically become an employee in the absence of agency action.’’ and in the absence of agency certification that the probationer will be an asset to the government, ‘‘the probationer’s employment should automatically terminate upon the expira tion of the probationary period.’’ this order directs this commonsense change. further, the regulations at subpart h of part 315 of title 5, code of federal regulations, which purport to limit agency action with respect to employees serving a probationary period, are not statutorily required, place undue burdens on agencies in terminating probationary employees, and deter man agers from undertaking that effort. to ensure that agencies make better use of probationary and trial periods, this order issues a new civil service rule xi that will supersede subpart h. under civil service rule xi, agencies will have to affirmatively determine that the continued employment of individuals serving probationary or trial periods would benefit the federal service before such appointments are finalized. sec. 2. repeal of civil service rule 2.4. civil service rule ii is amended by removing section 2.4 of part 2 of title 5, code of federal regulations. sec. 3. civil service rule xi. a new civil service rule xi is added following civil service rule x, to read as follows: ‘‘part 11—probationary and trial periods (rule xi) sec. lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc0 11.1 scope 11.2 probationary period; when required 11.3 trial period; when required 11.4 crediting service 11.5 completion of probationary or trial period 17730 federal register / vol. 90, no. 81 / tuesday, april 29, 2025 / presidential documents 11.6 appeals § 11.1 scope this rule applies to probationary periods in the competitive service and trial periods in the excepted service, except where provided otherwise by statute. it has no application to probationary periods in the senior executive service. § 11.2 probationary period; when required (a) the first year of service of an employee who is given a career or career-conditional appointment in the competitive service under the civil service regulations is a probationary period when the employee: (1) was appointed from a competitive list of eligibles. (2) was reinstated (including reinstatement from a reinstatement priority list), unless during any period of service that affords a current basis for reinstatement the employee completed a probationary period of at least 1 year or served with competitive status under an appointment that did not require a probationary period; provided that the date of reinstatement begins a new 12-month probationary period if one is required under paragraph (a) of this section. (b) a person who is required to go through a probationary period and then is transferred, promoted, demoted, or reassigned in accordance with the civil service regulations before he or she completes such period is required to complete the remainder of the probationary period in the new position. (c) upon noncompetitive appointment to the competitive service under the postal reorganization act (39 u.s.c. 101 et seq.), an employee of the postal career service (including a substitute or part-time flexible employee) who has not completed 1 year of postal service must serve the remainder of a 1-year probationary period in the new agency. (d) a person who is appointed to the competitive service either by a special appointing authority or by conversion to a career or career-conditional appointment under the civil service regulations must serve a 1-year proba tionary period unless specifically exempt from such period by the special appointing authority itself. (e) employees promoted, transferred, or otherwise assigned, for the first time, to supervisory or managerial positions shall be required to serve a probationary period under terms and conditions prescribed by the office of personnel management (opm). if an employee is required to concurrently serve both a probationary period in a supervisory or managerial position under 5 cfr part 315, subpart i, and a probationary or trial period following initial appointment or reinstatement under this civil service rule, the latter takes precedence and fulfills the requirements of this paragraph. § 11.3 trial period; when required (a) the first year of continuous service in the same or similar position of a preference eligible in the excepted service, or the first 2 years of continuous service in the same or similar position of an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible), is a trial period. (b) a person who is required to go through a trial period and is transferred, promoted, demoted, or reassigned before he or she completes the trial period is required to complete the remainder of the trial period in the new position. lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc0 (c) an individual who separates from the federal service for a period of more than 30 days after completing a trial period, and who subsequently is reappointed to an excepted service position, must complete a new trial period unless such individual is appointed to the same or a substantially similar position in the same agency as their most recently held position. § 11.4 crediting service (a) prior federal civilian service (including nonappropriated fund service) counts toward completion of a probationary or trial period, as applicable, when the prior service: (1) is in the same agency, e.g., department of the army; (2) is in the same line of work, as determined by the employee’s actual duties and responsibilities; and (3) contains or is followed by no more than a single break in service that does not exceed 30 calendar days. (b) periods of absence while in a pay status count toward completion of a probationary or trial period. absence in nonpay status while on the rolls (other than for compensable injury or military duty) is creditable up to a total of 22 workdays. absence (whether on or off the rolls) due to compensable injury or military duty is creditable in full upon restoration to federal service. nonpay time in excess of 22 workdays extends the probationary period or trial period by an equal amount. (c) the probationary or trial period for part-time employees is computed on the basis of calendar time, in the same manner as for full-time employees. for intermittent employees, i.e., those who do not have regularly scheduled tours of duty, each day or part of a day in pay status counts as one day of credit toward the 260 days or 520 days, as applicable, in a pay status required for completion of a probationary or trial period. under no circumstances shall the probationary or trial period be completed in less than 1 year of calendar time. § 11.5 completion of probationary or trial period (a) agencies shall utilize probationary and trial periods required upon initial appointment or subsequent reinstatement to evaluate employees’ fit ness and whether their continuation of employment advances the public interest. if not terminated sooner, an employee’s service terminates before the end of the tour of duty on the last day of their probationary or trial period unless their agency certifies within the 30 days prior to that date that finalizing their appointment advances the public interest. (b) a probationary or trial period ends when the employee completes his or her scheduled tour of duty on the day before the anniversary date (or, as applicable, 2-year anniversary date) of the employee’s appointment. for example, when the last workday is a friday and the anniversary date is the following monday, a probationer will be separated before the end of the tour of duty on friday if their agency does not make the requisite certification that their continued appointment advances the public interest. (c) an employee on a probationary or trial period bears the burden of demonstrating why their continuation in employment through the finalization of their appointment to the federal service is in the public interest. (d) in determining whether it is in the public interest to finalize the appointment to the federal service of an employee in a probationary or trial period, the agency head, or his or her designee, may consider, in his or her sole and exclusive discretion: (1) the employee’s performance and conduct; (2) the needs and interests of the agency; (3) whether the employee’s continued employment would advance organi zational goals of the agency or the government; and (4) whether the employee’s continued employment would advance the lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc0 efficiency of the service. (e) before an agency terminates the service of an employee serving a probationary or trial period, it shall notify such employee in writing as to the effective date of the action. (f) if an agency fails to make a certification under civil service rule 11.5 due to an administrative error, the agency head may petition the director of opm within 30 days from the date of termination to reinstate the employee. 17732 federal register / vol. 90, no. 81 / tuesday, april 29, 2025 / presidential documents (g) this section shall not apply to an employee serving a probationary period due to being promoted, transferred, or otherwise assigned, for the first time, to a supervisory or managerial position, unless such employee is required to concurrently serve both a probationary period in a supervisory or managerial position and a probationary or trial period following initial appointment or reinstatement under this civil service rule. § 11.6 appeals (a) the director of opm may by regulation prescribe circumstances under and procedures by which employees terminated from a probationary or trial period may appeal such termination. (b) except as otherwise required by law, such appeals shall be the sole and exclusive means of appealing terminations during probationary or trial periods.’’ sec. 4. modifications to the civil service regulations. (a) this order super sedes subpart h of part 315 of title 5, code of federal regulations (probation on initial appointment to a competitive position), which is hereby rendered inoperative and without effect. no agency shall give force or effect to its provisions. (b) the director of opm shall within 30 days of the date of this order prepare and publish a rule rescinding subpart h and making conforming amendments. sec. 5. review during probationary and trial periods.

(c) within 30 days of the end of each employee’s probationary or trial period, the agency head or an individual designated by the agency head pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, consistent with civil service rule xi and other applicable law, shall determine whether to finalize the employee’s appointment to the federal service, or whether to terminate their service.

14279,04/28/2025,Reforming Accreditation To Strengthen Higher Education,"presidential documents executive order 14279 of april 23, 2025 reforming accreditation to strengthen higher education by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. a group of higher education accreditors are the gate keepers that decide which colleges and universities american students can spend the more than $100 billion in federal student loans and pell grants dispersed each year. the accreditors’ job is to determine which institutions provide a quality education—and therefore merit accreditation. unfortu nately, accreditors have not only failed in this responsibility to students, families, and american taxpayers, but they have also abused their enormous authority. accreditors routinely approve institutions that are low-quality by the most important measures. the national six-year undergraduate graduation rate was an alarming 64 percent in 2020. further, many accredited institutions offer undergraduate and graduate programs with a negative return on invest ment—almost 25 percent of bachelor’s degrees and more than 40 percent of master’s degrees—which may leave students financially worse off and in enormous debt by charging them exorbitant sums for a degree with very modest earnings potential. notwithstanding this slide in graduation rates and graduates’ performance in the labor market, the spike in debt obligations in relation to expected earnings, and repayment rates on student loans, accreditors have remained improperly focused on compelling adoption of discriminatory ideology, rather than on student outcomes. some accreditors make the adoption of unlawfully discriminatory practices a formal standard of accreditation, and therefore a condition of accessing federal aid, through ‘‘diversity, equity, and inclu sion’’ or ‘‘dei’’-based standards of accreditation that require institutions to ‘‘share results on diversity, equity, and inclusion (dei) in the context of their mission by considering . . . demographics . . . and resource alloca tion.’’ accreditors have also abused their governance standards to intrude on state and local authority. the american bar association’s council of the section of legal education and admissions to the bar (council), which is the sole federally recognized accreditor for juris doctor programs, has required law schools to ‘‘dem onstrate by concrete action a commitment to diversity and inclusion’’ includ ing by ‘‘commit[ting] to having a student body [and faculty] that is diverse with respect to gender, race, and ethnicity.’’ as the attorney general has concluded and informed the council, the discriminatory requirement bla tantly violates the supreme court’s decision in students for fair admissions, inc. v. president and fellows of harvard college, 600 u.s. 181 (2023). though the council subsequently suspended its enforcement while it con siders proposed revisions, this standard and similar unlawful mandates must be permanently eradicated. khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc6 the liaison committee on medical education, which is the only federally recognized body that accredits doctor of medicine degree programs, requires that an institution ‘‘engage[ ] in ongoing, systematic, and focused recruitment and retention activities, to achieve mission-appropriate diversity outcomes among its students.’’ the accreditation council for graduate medical edu cation, which is the sole accreditor for both allopathic and osteopathic medical residency and fellowship programs, similarly ‘‘expect[s]’’ institutions 17530 federal register / vol. 90, no. 80 / monday, april 28, 2025 / presidential documents to focus on implementing ‘‘policies and procedures related to recruitment and retention of individuals underrepresented in medicine,’’ including ‘‘racial and ethnic minority individuals.’’ the standards for training tomorrow’s doctors should focus solely on providing the highest quality care, and cer tainly not on requiring unlawful discrimination. american students and taxpayers deserve better, and my administration will reform our dysfunctional accreditation system so that colleges and universities focus on delivering high-quality academic programs at a reason able price. federal recognition will not be provided to accreditors engaging in unlawful discrimination in violation of federal law. sec. 2. holding accreditors accountable for unlawful actions. (a) the sec retary of education shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, hold accountable, including through denial, monitoring, suspension, or termination of accreditation recognition, accreditors who fail to meet the applicable recognition criteria or otherwise violate federal law, including by requiring institutions seeking accreditation to engage in unlawful discrimi nation in accreditation-related activity under the guise of ‘‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’’ initiatives. (b) the attorney general and the secretary of education shall, as appro priate and consistent with applicable law, investigate and take appropriate action to terminate unlawful discrimination by american law schools that is advanced by the council, including unlawful ‘‘diversity, equity, and inclu sion’’ requirements under the guise of accreditation standards. the secretary of education shall also assess whether to suspend or terminate the council’s status as an accrediting agency under federal law. (c) the attorney general and the secretary of education, in consultation with the secretary of health and human services, shall investigate and take appropriate action to terminate unlawful discrimination by american medical schools or graduate medical education entities that is advanced by the liaison committee on medical education or the accreditation council for graduate medical education or other accreditors of graduate medical education, including unlawful ‘‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’’ require ments under the guise of accreditation standards. the secretary of education shall also assess whether to suspend or terminate the committee’s or the accreditation council’s status as an accrediting agency under federal law or take other appropriate action to ensure lawful conduct by medical schools, graduate medical education programs, and other entities that receive federal funding for medical education. sec. 3. new principles of student-oriented accreditation. (a) to realign accreditation with high-quality, valuable education for students, the secretary of education shall, consistent with applicable law, take appropriate steps to ensure that: (i) accreditation requires higher education institutions to provide high quality, high-value academic programs free from unlawful discrimination or other violations of federal law; (ii) barriers are reduced that limit institutions from adopting practices that advance credential and degree completion and spur new models of education; (iii) accreditation requires that institutions support and appropriately prioritize intellectual diversity amongst faculty in order to advance aca demic freedom, intellectual inquiry, and student learning; (iv) accreditors are not using their role under federal law to encourage khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc6 or force institution to violate state laws, unless such state laws violate the constitution or federal law; and (v) accreditors are prohibited from engaging in practices that result in credential inflation that burdens students with additional unnecessary costs. (b) to advance the policies and objectives in subsection (a) of this section, the secretary of education shall: (i) resume recognizing new accreditors to increase competition and ac countability in promoting high-quality, high-value academic programs fo cused on student outcomes; (ii) mandate that accreditors require member institutions to use data on program-level student outcomes to improve such outcomes, without ref erence to race, ethnicity, or sex; (iii) promptly provide to accreditors any noncompliance findings relating to member institutions issued after an investigation conducted by the office of civil rights under title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 (42 u.s.c. 2000d et seq.) or title ix of the education amendments act of 1972 (20 u.s.c. 1681 et seq.); (iv) launch an experimental site, pursuant to section 487a(b) of the higher education act of 1965 (20 u.s.c. 1094a(b)), to accelerate innovation and improve accountability by establishing new flexible and streamlined quality assurance pathways for higher education institutions that provide high quality, high-value academic programs; (v) increase the consistency, efficiency, and effectiveness of the accreditor recognition review process, including through the use of technology; (vi) streamline the process for higher education institutions to change accreditors to ensure institutions are not forced to comply with standards that are antithetical to institutional values and mission; and (vii) update the accreditation handbook to ensure that the accreditor recognition and reauthorization process is transparent, efficient, and not unduly burdensome. sec. 4. general provisions.

14280,04/28/2025,Reinstating Commonsense School Discipline Policies,"presidential documents executive order 14280 of april 23, 2025 reinstating commonsense school discipline policies by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, and to ensure safety and order in american classrooms, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose and policy. the federal government will no longer tolerate known risks to children’s safety and well-being in the classroom that result from the application of school discipline based on discriminatory and unlawful ‘‘equity’’ ideology. in january 2014, the department of education and the department of justice jointly issued a ‘‘dear colleague’’ letter regarding school discipline. in that letter, the department of education and the department of justice explained that schools could be found to violate title vi of the civil rights act of 1964—and therefore could lose federal funding—if their disciplinary decisions ran afoul of a newly imposed disparate-impact framework under which race-neutral disciplinary policies, applied in an even-handed manner, may be improper if members of any racial groups are suspended, expelled, or referred to law enforcement at higher rates than others. the letter effec tively required schools to discriminate on the basis of race by imposing discipline based on racial characteristics, rather than on objective behavior alone. the consequences harmed students and schools. a 2018 report from the federal commission on school safety (commission) noted evidence that, because of the 2014 letter, ‘‘schools ignored or covered up—rather than disciplined—student misconduct in order to avoid any purported racial dis parity in discipline numbers that might catch the eye of the federal govern ment.’’ as a result, students who should have been suspended or expelled for dangerous behavior remained in the classroom, making all students less safe. as the commission found: ‘‘when school leaders focus on aggregate school discipline numbers rather than the specific circumstances and conduct that underlie each matter, schools become less safe,’’ and ‘‘[r]esearch clearly indicates that the failure of schools to appropriately discipline disruptive students has consequences for overall student achievement.’’ the commis sion’s seemingly obvious conclusion was that ‘‘disciplinary decisions are best left in the hands of classroom teachers and administrators’’ and should be based on student behavior, rather than racial statistics. following the commission’s report on december 18, 2018, the 2014 dear colleague letter was rescinded. in 2023, however, the previous administra tion’s department of education and department of justice issued new guid ance noting that statistical racial disparities in student discipline may indicate violations of law, and encouraging schools to collect, analyze, and adjust their disciplinary policies in light of racial disciplinary data. the 2023 khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc7 guidance thus effectively reinstated the practice of weaponizing title vi to promote an approach to school discipline based on discriminatory equity ideology. as a consequence of these policies, teachers and students are suffering increased levels of classroom disorder and school violence. sec. 2. definitions. as used herein: (a) the definitions in the executive order of january 29, 2025 (ending radical indoctrination in k–12 schooling), shall apply to this order. 17534 federal register / vol. 90, no. 80 / monday, april 28, 2025 / presidential documents (b) ‘‘behavior modification techniques’’ means any school discipline poli cies or practices that incorporate or are based on discriminatory equity ideology. sec. 3. ensuring commonsense school discipline policies. (a) within 30 days of the date of this order, the secretary of education, in consultation with the attorney general, shall issue new guidance to local educational agencies (leas) and state educational agencies (seas) regarding school discipline and their obligations not to engage in racial discrimination under title vi in all contexts, including school discipline. (b) the secretary of education shall take appropriate action with respect to leas and seas that fail to comply with title vi protections against racial discrimination in the application of school discipline. (c) within 60 days of the date of this order, the secretary of education and the attorney general shall initiate coordination with governors and state attorneys general regarding the prevention of racial discrimination in the application of school discipline. (d) within 90 days of the date of this order, the secretary of defense shall issue a revised school discipline code that appropriately protects and enhances the education of the children of america’s military-service families. (e) within 120 days of the date of this order, the secretary of education shall, in coordination with the attorney general, the secretary of health and human services, and the secretary of homeland security, submit a report to the president, through the assistant to the president for domestic policy, regarding the status of discriminatory-equity-ideology-based school discipline and behavior modification techniques in american public edu cation. the report shall include: (i) an inventory and analysis of the nature and consequences of all title vi discipline-related investigations since 2009; (ii) an assessment of the role of non-profit organizations that are federal grant recipients in promoting discriminatory-equity-ideology-based dis cipline and behavior modification techniques, and recommendations to ensure that federal taxpayer funds do not flow to programs or activities, including those of non-profit organizations, that promote discriminatory equity-ideology-based discipline and behavior modification techniques; (iii) an assessment of discipline-related policies and curricular options that do not promote discriminatory equity ideology; and (iv) model school discipline policies that promote common sense, protect the safety and educational environment of students, do not promote unlaw ful discrimination, and are rooted in american values and traditional virtues. sec. 4. general provisions.

14281,04/28/2025,Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy,"presidential documents executive order 14281 of april 23, 2025 restoring equality of opportunity and meritocracy by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. a bedrock principle of the united states is that all citizens are treated equally under the law. this principle guarantees equality of opportunity, not equal outcomes. it promises that people are treated as individuals, not components of a particular race or group. it encourages meritocracy and a colorblind society, not race- or sex-based favoritism. adher ence to this principle is essential to creating opportunity, encouraging achievement, and sustaining the american dream. but a pernicious movement endangers this foundational principle, seeking to transform america’s promise of equal opportunity into a divisive pursuit of results preordained by irrelevant immutable characteristics, regardless of individual strengths, effort, or achievement. a key tool of this movement is disparate-impact liability, which holds that a near insurmountable pre sumption of unlawful discrimination exists where there are any differences in outcomes in certain circumstances among different races, sexes, or similar groups, even if there is no facially discriminatory policy or practice or discriminatory intent involved, and even if everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. disparate-impact liability all but requires individuals and busi nesses to consider race and engage in racial balancing to avoid potentially crippling legal liability. it not only undermines our national values, but also runs contrary to equal protection under the law and, therefore, violates our constitution. on a practical level, disparate-impact liability has hindered businesses from making hiring and other employment decisions based on merit and skill, their needs, or the needs of their customers because of the specter that such a process might lead to disparate outcomes, and thus disparate-impact lawsuits. this has made it difficult, and in some cases impossible, for employers to use bona fide job-oriented evaluations when recruiting, which prevents job seekers from being paired with jobs to which their skills are most suited—in other words, it deprives them of opportunities for success. because of disparate-impact liability, employers cannot act in the best inter ests of the job applicant, the employer, and the american public. disparate-impact liability imperils the effectiveness of civil rights laws by mandating, rather than proscribing, discrimination. as the supreme court put it, ‘‘[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.’’ disparate-impact liability is wholly inconsistent with the constitution and threatens the commitment to merit and equality of opportunity that forms khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc8 the foundation of the american dream. under my administration, citizens will be treated equally before the law and as individuals, not consigned to a certain fate based on their immutable characteristics. sec. 2. policy. it is the policy of the united states to eliminate the use of disparate-impact liability in all contexts to the maximum degree possible to avoid violating the constitution, federal civil rights laws, and basic american ideals. 17538 federal register / vol. 90, no. 80 / monday, april 28, 2025 / presidential documents sec. 3. revoking certain presidential actions. the following presidential approvals of the regulations promulgated under 42 u.s.c. 2000d–1 are hereby revoked: (a) the presidential approval of july 25, 1966, of the department of justice title vi regulations (31 fed. reg. 10269), as applied to 28 c.f.r. 42.104(b)(2) in full; and (b) the presidential approval of july 5, 1973, of the department of justice title vi regulations (38 fed. reg. 17955, fr doc. 73–13407), as applied to the words ‘‘or effect’’ in both places they appear in 28 c.f.r. 42.104(b)(3), and as applied to 28 c.f.r. 42.104(b)(6)(ii) and 28 c.f.r. 42.104(c)(2) in full. sec. 4. enforcement discretion to ensure lawful governance. given the limited enforcement resources of executive departments and agencies (agen cies), the unlawfulness of disparate-impact liability, and the policy of this order, all agencies shall deprioritize enforcement of all statutes and regula tions to the extent they include disparate-impact liability, including but not limited to 42 u.s.c. 2000e–2, 28 c.f.r. 42.104(b)(2)–(3), 28 c.f.r. 42.104(b)(6)(ii), and 28 c.f.r. 42.104(c)(2). sec. 5. existing regulations.

(a) the secretary of commerce, in consultation with the secretary of health and human services and with input from the united states fishing industry, shall immediately consider suspending, revising, or rescinding regulations that overly burden america’s commercial fishing, aquaculture, and fish processing industries at the fishery specific level. within 30 days of the date of this order, the secretary of commerce shall identify the most heavily overregulated fisheries requiring action and take appropriate action to reduce the regulatory burden on them, in cooperation with the regional fishery management councils, interagency partners, and through public-private partnerships, as appropriate. this proc ess shall include the following actions: 16994 federal register / vol. 90, no. 76 / tuesday, april 22, 2025 / presidential documents (i) the secretary of commerce shall request that each regional fishery management council, within 180 days of the date of this order, provide the secretary of commerce with updates to their recommendations sub mitted pursuant to executive order 13921, to reduce burdens on domestic fishing and to increase production. building upon the earlier goals, identi fied actions should stabilize markets, improve access, enhance economic profitability, and prevent closures. the regional fishery management councils will commit to a work plan and a schedule for implementation to ensure these actions are prioritized. (ii) the secretary of commerce shall solicit direct public comments, includ ing from fishing industry members, technology experts, marine scientists, and other relevant parties, for innovative ideas to improve fisheries manage ment and science within the requirements of the magnuson-stevens fishery conservation and management act (16 u.s.c. 1801 et seq.); the endangered species act of 1973 (16 u.s.c. 1531 et seq.); the marine mammal protection act (16 u.s.c. 1361 et seq.); and other applicable laws. (iii) the secretary of commerce shall pursue additional direct public engagement to ensure executive departments and agencies (agencies) are focusing core fisheries management and science functions to directly sup port priority needs that strengthen our nation’s seafood supply chain. (b) upon completion of the process described in subsection (a) of this section, the secretary of commerce shall consider updating the department of commerce’s contribution to the unified regulatory agenda. the secretary of commerce shall resume submission of annual reports to the director of the office of management and budget, the assistant to the president for economic policy, the assistant to the president for domestic policy, and the chairman of the council on environmental quality pursuant to these activities as described in executive order 13921. (c) the secretary of commerce shall direct the national marine fisheries service to incorporate less expensive and more reliable technologies and cooperative research programs into fishery assessments conducted pursuant to 16 u.s.c. 1867. as soon as practicable, the secretary of commerce shall expand exempted fishing permit programs to promote fishing opportunities nationwide. further, the secretary of commerce shall take all appropriate action to modernize data collection and analytical practices that will improve the responsiveness of fisheries management to real-time ocean conditions. (d) the secretary of commerce, in consultation with the secretary of agriculture, shall develop and implement an america first seafood strategy to promote production, marketing, sale, and export of united states fishery and aquaculture products and strengthen domestic processing capacity. this program shall accelerate the department of agriculture’s efforts to educate american consumers about the health benefits of seafood and increase sea food purchases in nutrition programs. (e) within 60 days of the date of this order, the secretary of commerce and the united states trade representative, in consultation with members of the interagency seafood trade task force, shall assess seafood competi tiveness issues and jointly develop a comprehensive seafood trade strategy. the strategy shall be based upon the seafood trade strategy of november 3, 2020, that improves access to foreign markets and addresses unfair trade practices—including iuu fishing and unjustified non-tariff barriers—while ensuring a fair and competitive domestic market for united states seafood producers. (f) the united states trade representative shall examine the relevant trade practices of major seafood-producing nations, including with regard to iuu fishing and the use of forced labor in the seafood supply chain, and consider appropriate responses, including pursuing solutions through negotiations or trade enforcement authorities, such as under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 (19 u.s.c. 2411). (g) the secretary of commerce, in consultation with the secretary of health and human services, the secretary of homeland security, and other relevant agencies, shall immediately consider revising or rescinding recent expansions of the seafood import monitoring program to unnecessary species and further improve the program to more effectively target high-risk ship ments from nations that routinely violate international fishery regulations. the secretary of commerce, the secretary of health and human services, and the secretary of homeland security shall use cost savings to improve thorough checks at united states ports to prevent iuu seafood from entering the market. the secretary of commerce shall further consider options to use improved technology to identify foreign fishery-related violations. (h) within 180 days of the date of this order, the secretary of commerce, in consultation with the secretary of the interior, shall review all existing marine national monuments and provide recommendations to the president of any that should be opened to commercial fishing. in making these rec ommendations, the secretary of commerce will consider whether the opening of the monuments to commercial fishing would be consistent with the preservation of the historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest originally identified in the proclamations establishing the marine national monuments. sec. 5. general provisions.

14272,04/18/2025,Ensuring National Security and Economic Resilience Through Section 232 Actions on Processed Critical Minerals and Derivative Products,"presidential documents executive order 14272 of april 15, 2025 ensuring national security and economic resilience through section 232 actions on processed critical minerals and de rivative products by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, including the trade expansion act of 1962, as amended (19 u.s.c. 1862) (the ‘‘act’’), it is hereby ordered: section 1. policy. a strong national defense depends on a robust economy and price stability, a resilient manufacturing and defense industrial base, and secure domestic supply chains. critical minerals, including rare earth elements, in the form of processed minerals are essential raw materials and critical production inputs required for economic and national security. critical mineral oxides, oxalates, salts, and metals (processed critical min erals), as well as their derivative products—the manufactured goods incor porating them—are similarly foundational to united states national security and defense. but processed critical minerals and their derivative products face significant global supply chain vulnerabilities and market distortions due to reliance on a small number of foreign suppliers. these vulnerabilities and distortions have led to significant united states import dependencies. the dependence of the united states on imports and the vulnerability of our supply chains raises the potential for risks to national security, defense readiness, price stability, and economic prosperity and resilience. processed critical minerals and their derivative products are essential for economic security and resilience because they underpin key industries, drive technological innovation, and support critical infrastructure vital for a mod ern american economy. they are key building blocks of our manufacturing base and foundational to sectors ranging from transportation and energy to telecommunications and advanced manufacturing. these economic sectors are, moreover, foundational to america’s national security. processed critical minerals and their derivative products are essential for national security because they are foundational to military infrastructure, energy infrastructure, and advanced defense systems and technologies. they are key building blocks of our defense industrial base and integral to applica tions such as jet engines, missile guidance systems, advanced computing, radar systems, advanced optics, and secure communications equipment. the united states manufacturing and defense industrial bases remain de pendent on foreign sources for processed critical mineral products. many of these foreign sources are at risk of serious, sustained, and long-term supply chain shocks. should the united states lose access to processed critical minerals from foreign sources, the united states commercial and defense manufacturing base for derivative products could face significant shortages and an inability to meet demand. lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc1 associated risks arise from a variety of factors. first, global supply chains are prone to disruption from geopolitical tensions, wars, natural disasters, pandemics, and trade conflicts. second, major global foreign producers of processed critical minerals have engaged in widespread price manipulation, overcapacity, arbitrary export restrictions, and the exploitation of their supply chain dominance to distort world markets and thereby gain geopolitical and economic leverage over 16438 federal register / vol. 90, no. 74 / friday, april 18, 2025 / presidential documents the united states and other competitors that depend on processed critical minerals to manufacture derivative products essential to their economic and national security and national defense. therefore, the import dependence of the united states on processed critical minerals from foreign sources may pose a serious national security risk to the united states economy and defense preparedness. third, the risks arising from america’s import dependence on processed critical minerals also extend to derivative products that are integral to the united states economy and economic and national security. for the united states to manufacture derivative products, it must have ready access to an affordable, resilient, and sustainable supply of processed critical minerals. simultaneously, a resilient and sustainable manufacturing base for derivative products is vital to creating a stable demand base for processed critical minerals. both must coexist to ensure economic stability and national secu rity. finally, overreliance on a small number of geographic regions amplifies the risks posed by geopolitical instability and regional disruptions. in light of the above risks and realities, an investigation under section 232 of the act (section 232) is necessary to determine whether imports of processed critical minerals and their derivative products threaten to impair national security. sec. 2. definitions. as used in this order: (a) the term ‘‘critical minerals’’ means those minerals included in the ‘‘critical minerals list’’ published by the united states geological survey (usgs) pursuant to section 7002(c) of the energy act of 2020 (30 u.s.c. 1606) at 87 fr 10381, or any subsequent such list. the term ‘‘critical minerals’’ also includes uranium. (b) the term ‘‘rare earth elements’’ means the 17 elements identified as rare earth elements by the department of energy (doe) in the april 2020 publication titled ‘‘critical materials rare earths supply chain.’’ the term also includes any additional elements that either the usgs or doe determines in any subsequent official report or publication should be consid ered rare earth elements. (c) the term ‘‘processed critical minerals’’ refers to critical minerals that have undergone the activities that occur after critical mineral ore is extracted from a mine up through its conversion into a metal, metal powder or a master alloy. these activities specifically occur beginning from the point at which ores are converted into oxide concentrates; separated into oxides; and converted into metals, metal powders, and master alloys. (d) the term ‘‘derivative products’’ includes all goods that incorporate processed critical minerals as inputs. these goods include semi-finished goods (such as semiconductor wafers, anodes, and cathodes) as well as final products (such as permanent magnets, motors, electric vehicles, bat teries, smartphones, microprocessors, radar systems, wind turbines and their components, and advanced optical devices). sec. 3. section 232 investigation. (a) the secretary of commerce shall initiate an investigation under section 232 to determine the effects on national security of imports of processed critical minerals and their derivative prod ucts. (b) in conducting the investigation described in subsection (a) of this section, the secretary of commerce shall assess the factors set forth in 19 u.s.c. 1862(d), labeled ‘‘domestic production for national defense; impact lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc1 of foreign competition on economic welfare of domestic industries,’’ as well as other relevant factors, including: (i) identification of united states imports of all processed critical minerals and derivative products incorporating such processed critical minerals; (ii) the foreign sources by percent and volume of all processed critical mineral imports and derivative product imports, the specific types of risks that may be associated with each source by country, and those source countries deemed to be of significant risk; (iii) an analysis of the distortive effects of the predatory economic, pricing, and market manipulation strategies and practices used by countries that process critical minerals that are exported to the united states, including the distortive effects on domestic investment and the viability of united states production, as well as an assessment of how such strategies and practices permit such countries to maintain their control over the critical minerals processing sector and distort united states market prices for derivative products; (iv) an analysis of the demand for processed critical minerals by manufac turers of derivative products in the united states and globally, including an assessment of the extent to which such manufacturers’ demand for processed critical minerals originates from countries identified under sub sections (b)(ii) and (b)(iii) of this section; (v) a review and risk assessment of global supply chains for processed critical minerals and their derivative products; (vi) an analysis of the current and potential capabilities of the united states to process critical minerals and their derivative products; and (vii) the dollar value of the current level of imports of all processed critical minerals and derivative products by total value and country of export. (c) the secretary of commerce shall, consistent with applicable law, pro ceed expeditiously in conducting the investigation as follows: (i) within 90 days of the date of this order, the secretary of commerce shall submit for internal review and comment a draft interim report to the secretary of the treasury, the secretary of defense, the united states trade representative, the assistant to the president for economic policy, and the senior counselor to the president for trade and manufacturing. (ii) comments to the secretary of commerce from the officials identified in subsection (c)(i) of this section shall be provided within 15 days of submission of the draft interim report described in subsection (c)(i) of this section. (iii) the secretary of commerce shall submit a final report and rec ommendations to the president within 180 days of the investigation’s commencement. (d) in considering whether to make recommendations for action or inaction pursuant to section 232(b) of the act (19 u.s.c. 1862(b)), the secretary of commerce shall consider: (i) the imposition of tariffs as well as other import restrictions and their appropriate levels; (ii) safeguards to avoid circumvention and any weakening of the section 232 measures; (iii) policies to incentivize domestic production, processing, and recycling; and (iv) any additional measures that may be warranted to mitigate united states national security risks, as appropriate, under the president’s author ity pursuant to the international emergency economic powers act (50 u.s.c. 1701 et seq.). sec. 4. general provisions.

14273,04/18/2025,Lowering Drug Prices by Once Again Putting Americans First,"presidential documents executive order 14273 of april 15, 2025 lowering drug prices by once again putting americans first by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. my first term included numerous significant actions, including some of the most aggressive in recent history, to deliver lower prescription drug prices to american patients. the message was clear: no longer would the executive branch sit idly by as pharmaceutical manufactur ers charged patients in our nation more than those in other countries for the exact same prescription drugs, often made in the exact same places. these actions included encouraging the development of generic and bio similar alternatives to higher cost brand name prescription drugs and bio logics to harness competitive forces and increase access to affordable medi cines. the united states also, for the first time, established a pathway to expand access to lower cost drugs imported from outside of the country. reform efforts ensured that government-mandated discounts were passed through to patients instead of being retained by middlemen. new price transparency rules were promulgated to allow patients, doctors, and employ ers to see the actual cost of prescription drugs before purchase. insulin copayments were capped for medicare beneficiaries, and manufacturers, in stead of patients and taxpayers, were forced to foot the bill through the provision of larger discounts. i also called on the congress to come to the table to help craft sustainable solutions that would promote innovation and affordable access for the long-term. when the congress refused, i pro posed the test of an innovative new payment mechanism that would prevent drug manufacturers from charging our patients much higher prices than those found abroad. combined, these bold actions were delivering real savings for american patients and set the foundation to dramatically narrow the price disparity between the united states and foreign nations over time. unsurprisingly, the biden administration reversed, walked back, or neglected many of these initiatives, undoing the progress made for american patients. the biden administration then signed into law the misnamed inflation reduction act, which included the medicare prescription drug negotiation program. while this program has the commendable goal of reducing the drug prices medicare and its beneficiaries pay, its administratively complex and expensive regime has thus far produced much lower savings than pro jected. further, accompanying changes to the medicare part d program led to inflated premiums and diminished coverage choices for seniors, prompting a taxpayer-funded bailout of insurance companies offering part d plans. finally, the program imposes price controls on small molecule prescription drugs, usually in tablet or capsule form, 4 years earlier than on large molecule biological products. known as the ‘‘pill penalty,’’ this discrepancy threatens lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc2 to distort innovation by pushing investment towards expensive biological products, which are often indicated to treat rarer diseases, and away from small molecule prescription drugs, which are generally cheaper and treat larger patient populations. the american people deserve better. it is time to restore the progress our nation made in my first term to deliver lower prescription drug prices by putting americans first and making america healthy again. 16442 federal register / vol. 90, no. 74 / friday, april 18, 2025 / presidential documents sec. 2. policy. it is the policy of the united states that federal health care programs, intellectual property protections, and safety regulations are optimized to provide access to prescription drugs at lower costs to american patients and taxpayers. sec. 3. improving upon the inflation reduction act. (a) within 60 days of the date of this order, the secretary of health and human services (secretary), consistent with sections 1191 to 1198 of the social security act (42 u.s.c. 1320f–1320f–7) and other applicable law, shall propose and seek comment on guidance for the medicare drug price negotiation program for initial price applicability year 2028 and manufacturer effectuation of maximum fair price under such program in 2026, 2027, and 2028. the guidance shall improve the transparency of the medicare drug price negotia tion program, prioritize the selection of prescription drugs with high costs to the medicare program, and minimize any negative impacts of the maximum fair price on pharmaceutical innovation within the united states. (b) within 180 days of the date of this order, the assistant to the president for domestic policy, in coordination with the secretary, the director of the office of management and budget (omb director), and the assistant to the president for economic policy, shall provide recommendations to the president on how best to stabilize and reduce medicare part d premiums. (c) the secretary shall work with the congress to modify the medicare drug price negotiation program to align the treatment of small molecule prescription drugs with that of biological products, ending the distortion that undermines relative investment in small molecule prescription drugs, coupled with other reforms to prevent any increase in overall costs to medicare and its beneficiaries. sec. 4. reducing the prices of high-cost drugs for seniors. within 1 year of the date of this order, the secretary shall take appropriate steps to develop and implement a rulemaking plan and select for testing, consistent with 42 u.s.c. 1315a(b)(2), a payment model to improve the ability of the medicare program to obtain better value for high-cost prescription drugs and biological products covered by medicare, including those not subject to the medicare drug price negotiation program. sec. 5. appropriately accounting for acquisition costs of drugs in medicare. within 180 days of the date of this order, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the secretary shall publish in the federal register a plan to conduct a survey under section 1833(t)(14)(d)(ii) of the social security act to determine the hospital acquisition cost for covered outpatient drugs at hospital outpatient departments. following the conclusion of this survey, the secretary shall consider and propose any appropriate adjustments that would align medicare payment with the cost of acquisition, consistent with the budget neutrality requirement in section 1833(t)(9)(b) of the social security act and other legal requirements. sec. 6. promoting innovation, value, and enhanced oversight in medicaid drug payment. within 180 days of the date of this order, the omb director, the assistant to the president for domestic policy, and the assistant to the president for economic policy, in coordination with the secretary, shall jointly provide recommendations to the president on how best to ensure that manufacturers pay accurate medicaid drug rebates consistent with sec tion 1927 of the social security act, promote innovation in medicaid drug payment methodologies, link payments for drugs to the value obtained, and support states in managing drug spending. lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc2 sec. 7. access to affordable life-saving medications. within 90 days of the date of this order, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the secretary shall take action to ensure future grants available under section 330(e) of the public health service act, as amended, 42 u.s.c. 254b(e), are conditioned upon health centers establishing practices to make insulin and injectable epinephrine available at or below the discounted price paid by the health center grantee or sub-grantee under the 340b prescription drug program (plus a minimal administration fee) to individuals with low incomes, as determined by the secretary, who: (a) have a high cost-sharing requirement for either insulin or injectable epinephrine;

(ieepa), the national emer gencies act (50 u.s.c. 1601 et seq.), section 604 of the trade act of 1974, as amended (19 u.s.c. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, united states code, i hereby determine and order: section 1. background. in executive order 14257 of april 2, 2025 (regulating imports with a reciprocal tariff to rectify trade practices that contribute to large and persistent annual united states goods trade deficits), i declared a national emergency arising from conditions reflected in large and persistent annual u.s. goods trade deficits, and imposed additional ad valorem duties that i deemed necessary and appropriate to deal with that unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the united states, to the national security and economy of the united states. section 4(b) of executive order 14257 provided that ‘‘[s]hould any trading partner retaliate against the united states in response to this action through import duties on u.s. exports or other measures, i may further modify the [harmonized tariff schedule of the united states] to increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.’’ in the executive order dated april 8, 2025 (amendment to reciprocal tariffs and updated duties as applied to low-value imports from the people’s republic of china), pursuant to section 4(b) of executive order 14257, i ordered modification of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states (htsus) to raise the applicable ad valorem duty rate for imports from the people’s republic of china (prc) established in executive order 14257, in recognition of the fact that the prc announced that it would retaliate against the united states in response to executive order 14257. on april 9, 2025, the state council tariff commission of the prc announced that, in response to the executive order dated april 8, 2025, an 84 percent tariff would be imposed on all goods imported into the prc originating from the united states, effective at 12:01 a.m. on april 10, 2025. pursuant to section 4(b) of executive order 14257, i have determined that it is nec essary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in that order by modifying the htsus and taking other actions to increase the duties imposed on the prc in response to this latest retaliation. in my judgment, this modification is necessary and appropriate to effectively ad dress the threat to u.s. national and economic security posed by the prc’s contribution to the conditions reflected in large and persistent trade deficits, including prc industrial policies that have produced systemic excess manulotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc3 facturing capacity in the prc and suppressed u.s. domestic manufacturing capacity, which conditions are made worse by the prc’s recent actions. section 4(c) of executive order 14257 provided that, ‘‘[s]hould any trading partner take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align sufficiently with the united states on economic and national security matters, i may further modify the htsus to decrease or limit in scope the duties imposed under this order.’’ since i signed executive 15626 federal register / vol. 90, no. 71 / tuesday, april 15, 2025 / presidential documents order 14257, in contrast to the prc’s actions, more than 75 other foreign trading partners, including countries enumerated in annex i to executive order 14257, have approached the united states to address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationships and our resulting national and economic security concerns. this is a significant step by these countries toward remedying non-reciprocal trade arrangements and aligning sufficiently with the united states on economic and national security matters. pursuant to section 4(c) of executive order 14257, i have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in that order by modifying the htsus to temporarily suspend, for a period of 90 days, except with respect to the prc, application of the individual ad valorem duties imposed for foreign trading partners listed in annex i to executive order 14257, and to instead impose on articles of all such trading partners an additional ad valorem rate of duty as set forth

law, subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10 percent, subject to all applicable exceptions set forth in executive order 14257. sec. 3. tariff modifications. in recognition of the fact that the prc has announced that it will retaliate again against the united states in response to the executive order dated april 8, 2025, which amended executive order 14257, and in recognition of the sincere intentions by many other trading partners to facilitate a resolution to the national emergency declared in executive order 14257, the htsus shall be modified as follows: effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on april 10, 2025: (a) heading 9903.01.25 of the htsus shall be amended by

14260,04/14/2025,Protecting American Energy From State Overreach,"presidential documents executive order 14260 of april 8, 2025 protecting american energy from state overreach by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. my administration is committed to unleashing american energy, especially through the removal of all illegitimate impediments to the identification, development, siting, production, investment in, or use of domestic energy resources—particularly oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, geothermal, biofuel, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources. an afford able and reliable domestic energy supply is essential to the national and economic security of the united states, as well as our foreign policy. simply put, americans are better off when the united states is energy dominant. american energy dominance is threatened when state and local governments seek to regulate energy beyond their constitutional or statutory authorities. for example, when states target or discriminate against out-of-state energy producers by imposing significant barriers to interstate and international trade, american energy suffers, and the equality of each state enshrined by the constitution is undermined. similarly, when states subject energy producers to arbitrary or excessive fines through retroactive penalties or seek to control energy development, siting, or production activities on federal land, american energy suffers. many states have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, burdensome and ideologically motivated ‘‘climate change’’ or energy policies that threaten american energy dominance and our economic and national security. new york, for example, enacted a ‘‘climate change’’ extortion law that seeks to retroactively impose billions in fines (erroneously labelled ‘‘compensatory payments’’) on traditional energy producers for their purported past contribu tions to greenhouse gas emissions not only in new york but also anywhere in the united states and the world. vermont similarly extorts energy pro ducers for alleged past contributions to greenhouse gas emissions anywhere in the united states or the globe. other states have taken different approaches in an effort to dictate national energy policy. california, for example, punishes carbon use by adopting impossible caps on the amount of carbon businesses may use, all but forcing businesses to pay large sums to ‘‘trade’’ carbon credits to meet california’s radical requirements. some states delay review of permit applications to produce energy, creating de facto barriers to entry in the energy market. states have also sued energy companies for supposed ‘‘climate change’’ harm under nuisance or other tort regimes that could result in crippling damages. these state laws and policies weaken our national security and devastate americans by driving up energy costs for families coast-to-coast, despite some of these families not living or voting in states with these crippling policies. these laws and policies also undermine federalism by projecting the regulatory preferences of a few states into all states. americans must be permitted to heat their homes, fuel their cars, and have peace of mind— free from policies that make energy more expensive and inevitably degrade quality of life. these state laws and policies try to dictate interstate and international disputes over air, water, and natural resources; unduly discriminate against 15514 federal register / vol. 90, no. 70 / monday, april 14, 2025 / presidential documents out-of-state businesses; contravene the equality of states; and retroactively impose arbitrary and excessive fines without legitimate justification. these state laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my administration’s objective to unleash american energy. they should not stand. sec. 2. state laws and causes of action. (a) the attorney general, in consultation with the heads of appropriate executive departments and agen cies, shall identify all state and local laws, regulations, causes of action, policies, and practices (collectively, state laws) burdening the identification, development, siting, production, or use of domestic energy resources that are or may be unconstitutional, preempted by federal law, or otherwise unenforceable. the attorney general shall prioritize the identification of any such state laws purporting to address ‘‘climate change’’ or involving ‘‘environmental, social, and governance’’ initiatives, ‘‘environmental justice,’’ carbon or ‘‘greenhouse gas’’ emissions, and funds to collect carbon penalties or carbon taxes. (b) the attorney general shall expeditiously take all appropriate action to stop the enforcement of state laws and continuation of civil actions identified in subsection (a) of this section that the attorney general deter mines to be illegal. (c) within 60 days of the date of this order, the attorney general shall submit a report to the president, through the counsel to the president, regarding actions taken under subsection (b) of this section. the attorney general shall also recommend any additional presidential or legislative action necessary to stop the enforcement of state laws identified in subsection (a) of this section that the attorney general determines to be illegal or otherwise fulfill the purpose of this order. sec. 3. general provisions.

14257,04/07/2025,Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits,"15041 vol. 90, no. 65 monday, april 7, 2025 title 3— executive order 14257 of april 2, 2025 the president regulating imports with a reciprocal tariff to rectify trade practices that contribute to large and persistent an nual united states goods trade deficits by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, including the international emergency economic powers act (50 u.s.c. 1701 et seq.)(ieepa), the national emer gencies act (50 u.s.c. 1601 et seq.)(nea), section 604 of the trade act of 1974, as amended (19 u.s.c. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, united states code, i, donald j. trump, president of the united states of america, find that underlying conditions, including a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and u.s. trading partners’ economic policies that suppress domestic wages and con sumption, as indicated by large and persistent annual u.s. goods trade deficits, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national secu rity and economy of the united states. that threat has its source in whole or substantial part outside the united states in the domestic economic policies of key trading partners and structural imbalances in the global trading system. i hereby declare a national emergency with respect to this threat. on january 20, 2025, i signed the america first trade policy presidential memorandum directing my administration to investigate the causes of our country’s large and persistent annual trade deficits in goods, including the economic and national security implications and risks resulting from such deficits, and to undertake a review of, and identify, any unfair trade practices by other countries. on february 13, 2025, i signed a presidential memo randum entitled ‘‘reciprocal trade and tariffs,’’ that directed further review of our trading partners’ non-reciprocal trading practices, and noted the rela tionship between non-reciprocal practices and the trade deficit. on april 1, 2025, i received the final results of those investigations, and i am taking action today based on those results. large and persistent annual u.s. goods trade deficits have led to the hollowing out of our manufacturing base; inhibited our ability to scale advanced domestic manufacturing capacity; undermined critical supply chains; and rendered our defense-industrial base dependent on foreign adver saries. large and persistent annual u.s. goods trade deficits are caused in substantial part by a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships. this situation is evidenced by disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers that make it harder for u.s. manufacturers to sell their products in foreign markets. it is also evidenced by the economic policies of key u.s. trading partners insofar as they suppress domestic wages and consumption, and thereby demand for u.s. exports, while artificially increasing the competitive ness of their goods in global markets. these conditions have given rise lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc2 to the national emergency that this order is intended to abate and resolve. for decades starting in 1934, u.s. trade policy has been organized around the principle of reciprocity. the congress directed the president to secure reduced reciprocal tariff rates from key trading partners first through bilateral trade agreements and later under the auspices of the global trading system. between 1934 and 1945, the executive branch negotiated and signed 32 bilateral reciprocal trade agreements designed to lower tariff rates on a 15042 federal register / vol. 90, no. 65 / monday, april 7, 2025 / presidential documents reciprocal basis. after 1947 through 1994, participating countries engaged in eight rounds of negotiation, which resulted in the general agreements on tariffs and trade (gatt) and seven subsequent tariff reduction rounds. however, despite a commitment to the principle of reciprocity, the trading relationship between the united states and its trading partners has become highly unbalanced, particularly in recent years. the post-war international economic system was based upon three incorrect assumptions: first, that if the united states led the world in liberalizing tariff and non-tariff barriers the rest of the world would follow; second, that such liberalization would ultimately result in more economic convergence and increased domestic consumption among u.s. trading partners converging towards the share in the united states; and third, that as a result, the united states would not accrue large and persistent goods trade deficits. this framework set in motion events, agreements, and commitments that did not result in reciprocity or generally increase domestic consumption in foreign economies relative to domestic consumption in the united states. those events, in turn, created large and persistent annual u.s. goods trade deficits as a feature of the global trading system. put simply, while world trade organization (wto) members agreed to bind their tariff rates on a most-favored-nation (mfn) basis, and thereby provide their best tariff rates to all wto members, they did not agree to bind their tariff rates at similarly low levels or to apply tariff rates on a reciprocal basis. consequently, according to the wto, the united states has among the lowest simple average mfn tariff rates in the world at 3.3 percent, while many of our key trading partners like brazil (11.2 percent), china (7.5 percent), the european union (eu) (5 percent), india (17 percent), and vietnam (9.4 percent) have simple average mfn tariff rates that are significantly higher. moreover, these average mfn tariff rates conceal much larger discrepancies across economies in tariff rates applied to particular products. for example, the united states imposes a 2.5 percent tariff on passenger vehicle imports (with internal combustion engines), while the european union (10 percent), india (70 percent), and china (15 percent) impose much higher duties on the same product. for network switches and routers, the united states imposes a 0 percent tariff, but for similar products, india (10 percent) levies a higher rate. brazil (18 percent) and indonesia (30 percent) impose a higher tariff on ethanol than does the united states (2.5 percent). for rice in the husk, the u.s. mfn tariff is 2.7 percent (ad valorem equivalent), while india (80 percent), malaysia (40 percent), and turkey (an average of 31 percent) impose higher rates. apples enter the united states duty-free, but not so in turkey (60.3 percent) and india (50 percent). similarly, non-tariff barriers also deprive u.s. manufacturers of reciprocal access to markets around the world. the 2025 national trade estimate report on foreign trade barriers (nte) details a great number of non tariff barriers to u.s. exports around the world on a trading-partner by trading-partner basis. these barriers include import barriers and licensing restrictions; customs barriers and shortcomings in trade facilitation; technical barriers to trade (e.g., unnecessarily trade restrictive standards, conformity assessment procedures, or technical regulations); sanitary and phytosanitary measures that unnecessarily restrict trade without furthering safety objectives; inadequate patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark regimes and inad equate enforcement of intellectual property rights; discriminatory licensing requirements or regulatory standards; barriers to cross-border data flows lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc2 and discriminatory practices affecting trade in digital products; investment barriers; subsidies; anticompetitive practices; discrimination in favor of do mestic state-owned enterprises, and failures by governments in protecting labor and environment standards; bribery; and corruption. moreover, non-tariff barriers include the domestic economic policies and practices of our trading partners, including currency practices and value added taxes, and their associated market distortions, that suppress domestic consumption and boost exports to the united states. this lack of reciprocity is apparent in the fact that the share of consumption to gross domestic product (gdp) in the united states is about 68 percent, but it is much lower in others like ireland (27 percent), singapore (31 percent), china (39 percent), south korea (49 percent), and germany (50 percent). at the same time, efforts by the united states to address these imbalances have stalled. trading partners have repeatedly blocked multilateral and plurilateral solutions, including in the context of new rounds of tariff negotia tions and efforts to discipline non-tariff barriers. at the same time, with the u.s. economy disproportionately open to imports, u.s. trading partners have had few incentives to provide reciprocal treatment to u.s. exports in the context of bilateral trade negotiations. these structural asymmetries have driven the large and persistent annual u.s. goods trade deficit. even for countries with which the united states may enjoy an occasional bilateral trade surplus, the accumulation of tariff and non-tariff barriers on u.s. exports may make that surplus smaller than it would have been without such barriers. permitting these asymmetries to continue is not sustainable in today’s economic and geopolitical environ ment because of the effect they have on u.s. domestic production. a nation’s ability to produce domestically is the bedrock of its national and economic security. both my first administration in 2017, and the biden administration in 2022, recognized that increasing domestic manufacturing is critical to u.s. national security. according to 2023 united nations data, u.s. manufacturing output as a share of global manufacturing output was 17.4 percent, down from a peak in 2001 of 28.4 percent. over time, the persistent decline in u.s. manufacturing output has reduced u.s. manufacturing capacity. the need to maintain robust and resilient domestic manufacturing capacity is particularly acute in certain advanced industrial sectors like automobiles, shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, technology products, machine tools, and basic and fabricated metals, because once competitors gain sufficient global market share in these sectors, u.s. produc tion could be permanently weakened. it is also critical to scale manufacturing capacity in the defense-industrial sector so that we can manufacture the defense materiel and equipment necessary to protect american interests at home and abroad. in fact, because the united states has supplied so much military equipment to other countries, u.s. stockpiles of military goods are too low to be compatible with u.s. national defense interests. furthermore, u.s. defense companies must develop new, advanced manufacturing technologies across a range of critical sectors including bio-manufacturing, batteries, and micro electronics. if the united states wishes to maintain an effective security umbrella to defend its citizens and homeland, as well as for its allies and partners, it needs to have a large upstream manufacturing and goods producing ecosystem to manufacture these products without undue reliance on imports for key inputs. increased reliance on foreign producers for goods also has compromised u.s. economic security by rendering u.s. supply chains vulnerable to geo political disruption and supply shocks. in recent years, the vulnerability of the u.s. economy in this respect was exposed both during the covid– 19 pandemic, when americans had difficulty accessing essential products, as well as when the houthi rebels later began attacking cargo ships in lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc2 the middle east. the decline of u.s. manufacturing capacity threatens the u.s. economy in other ways, including through the loss of manufacturing jobs. from 1997 to 2024, the united states lost around 5 million manufacturing jobs and experienced one of the largest drops in manufacturing employment in history. furthermore, many manufacturing job losses were concentrated in specific geographical areas. in these areas, the loss of manufacturing jobs contributed 15044 federal register / vol. 90, no. 65 / monday, april 7, 2025 / presidential documents to the decline in rates of family formation and to the rise of other social trends, like the abuse of opioids, that have imposed profound costs on the u.s. economy. the future of american competitiveness depends on reversing these trends. today, manufacturing represents just 11 percent of u.s. gross domestic product, yet it accounts for 35 percent of american productivity growth and 60 percent of our exports. importantly, u.s. manufacturing is the main engine of innovation in the united states, responsible for 55 percent of all patents and 70 percent of all research and development (r&d) spending. the fact that r&d expenditures by u.s. multinational enterprises in china grew at an average rate of 13.6 percent a year between 2003 and 2017, while their r&d expenditures in the united states grew by an average of just 5 percent per year during the same time period, is evidence of the strong link between manufacturing and innovation. furthermore, every manufacturing job spurs 7 to 12 new jobs in other related industries, helping to build and sustain our economy. just as a nation that does not produce manufactured products cannot maintain the industrial base it needs for national security, neither can a nation long survive if it cannot produce its own food. presidential policy directive 21 of february 12, 2013 (critical infrastructure security and resilience), designates food and agriculture as a ‘‘critical infrastructure sector’’ because it is one of the sectors considered ‘‘so vital to the united states that [its] incapacity or destruction . . . would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combina tion of those matters.’’ furthermore, when i left office, the united states had a trade surplus in agricultural products, but today, that surplus has vanished. eviscerated by a slew of new non-tariff barriers imposed by our trading partners, it has been replaced by a projected $49 billion annual agricultural trade deficit. for these reasons, i hereby declare and order: section 1. national emergency. as president of the united states, my highest duty is ensuring the national and economic security of the country and its citizens. i have declared a national emergency arising from conditions reflected in large and persistent annual u.s. goods trade deficits, which have grown by over 40 percent in the past 5 years alone, reaching $1.2 trillion in 2024. this trade deficit reflects asymmetries in trade relationships that have contributed to the atrophy of domestic production capacity, especially that of the u.s. manufacturing and defense-industrial base. these asymmetries also impact u.s. producers’ ability to export and, consequentially, their incentive to produce. specifically, such asymmetry includes not only non-reciprocal differences in tariff rates among foreign trading partners, but also extensive use of non-tariff barriers by foreign trading partners, which reduce the competitive ness of u.s. exports while artificially enhancing the competitiveness of their own goods. these non-tariff barriers include technical barriers to trade; non-scientific sanitary and phytosanitary rules; inadequate intellectual prop erty protections; suppressed domestic consumption (e.g., wage suppression); weak labor, environmental, and other regulatory standards and protections; and corruption. these non-tariff barriers give rise to significant imbalances even when the united states and a trading partner have comparable tariff rates. lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc2 the cumulative effect of these imbalances has been the transfer of resources from domestic producers to foreign firms, reducing opportunities for domestic manufacturers to expand and, in turn, leading to lost manufacturing jobs, diminished manufacturing capacity, and an atrophied industrial base, includ ing in the defense-industrial sector. at the same time, foreign firms are better positioned to scale production, reinvest in innovation, and compete in the global economy, to the detriment of u.s. economic and national security. the absence of sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity in certain critical and advanced industrial sectors—another outcome of the large and persistent annual u.s. goods trade deficits—also compromises u.s. economic and na tional security by rendering the u.s. economy less resilient to supply chain disruption. finally, the large, persistent annual u.s. goods trade deficits, and the concomitant loss of industrial capacity, have compromised military readiness; this vulnerability can only be redressed through swift corrective action to rebalance the flow of imports into the united states. such impact upon military readiness and our national security posture is especially acute with the recent rise in armed conflicts abroad. i call upon the public and private sector to make the efforts necessary to strengthen the international economic position of the united states. sec. 2. reciprocal tariff policy. it is the policy of the united states to rebalance global trade flows by imposing an additional ad valorem duty on all imports from all trading partners except as otherwise provided herein. the additional ad valorem duty on all imports from all trading partners shall start at 10 percent and shortly thereafter, the additional ad valorem duty shall increase for trading partners enumerated in annex i to this

14253,04/03/2025,Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,"presidential documents executive order 14253 of march 27, 2025 restoring truth and sanity to american history by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose and policy. over the past decade, americans have wit nessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our nation’s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth. this revisionist movement seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the united states by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light. under this historical revision, our nation’s unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness is reconstructed as inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed. rather than fostering unity and a deeper understanding of our shared past, the widespread effort to rewrite history deepens societal divides and fosters a sense of national shame, disregarding the progress america has made and the ideals that continue to inspire millions around the globe. the prior administration advanced this corrosive ideology. at independence national historical park in philadelphia, pennsylvania—where our nation declared that all men are created equal—the prior administration sponsored training by an organization that advocates dismantling ‘‘western foundations’’ and ‘‘interrogating institutional racism’’ and pressured national historical park rangers that their racial identity should dictate how they convey history to visiting americans because america is purportedly racist. once widely respected as a symbol of american excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement, the smithsonian institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology. this shift has promoted narratives that portray american and western values as inherently harmful and oppressive. for example, the smithsonian amer ican art museum today features ‘‘the shape of power: stories of race and american sculpture,’’ an exhibit representing that ‘‘[s]ocieties including the united states have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.’’ the exhibit further claims that ‘‘sculpture has been a powerful tool in promoting scientific racism’’ and promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct, stating ‘‘race is a human invention.’’ the national museum of african american history and culture has pro claimed that ‘‘hard work,’’ ‘‘individualism,’’ and ‘‘the nuclear family’’ are aspects of ‘‘white culture.’’ the forthcoming smithsonian american women’s history museum plans on celebrating the exploits of male athletes partici pating in women’s sports. these are just a few examples. it is the policy of my administration to restore federal sites dedicated to history, including parks and museums, to solemn and uplifting public monuments that remind americans of our extraordinary heritage, consistent khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc4 progress toward becoming a more perfect union, and unmatched record of advancing liberty, prosperity, and human flourishing. museums in our nation’s capital should be places where individuals go to learn—not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history. to advance this policy, we will restore the smithsonian institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and american greatness—igniting 14564 federal register / vol. 90, no. 63 / thursday, april 3, 2025 / presidential documents the imagination of young minds, honoring the richness of american history and innovation, and instilling pride in the hearts of all americans. sec. 2. saving our smithsonian. (a) the vice president, in consultation with the assistant to the president for domestic policy and the special assistant to the president and senior associate staff secretary, lindsey halligan, esq., shall work to effectuate the policies of this order through his role on the smithsonian board of regents with respect to the smithsonian institution and its museums, education and research centers, and the national zoo, including by seeking to remove improper ideology from such properties, and shall recommend to the president any additional actions necessary to fully effectuate such policies. (b) the vice president and the director of the office of management and budget shall work with the congress to ensure that future appropriations to the smithsonian institution: (i) prohibit expenditure on exhibits or programs that degrade shared amer ican values, divide americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy; and (ii) celebrate the achievements of women in the american women’s history museum and do not recognize men as women in any respect in the museum. (c) the director of the office of management and budget and the secretary of the interior shall take any other measures within their authority to promote the policy of this order. (d) as appropriate, the vice president shall, in consultation with the assistant to the president for domestic policy and special assistant to the president and senior associate staff secretary, lindsey halligan, esq., work with the speaker of the house of representatives and the senate majority leader, to seek the appointment of citizen members to the smithso nian board of regents committed to advancing the policy of this order. sec. 3. restoring independence hall. the secretary of the interior shall provide sufficient funding, as available, to improve the infrastructure of independence national historical park, which shall be complete by july 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the signing of the declaration of independ ence. sec. 4. restoring truth in american history.

(a) america’s live concert and entertainment industry is the envy of the world. but it has become blighted by unscrupulous middlemen who sit at the intersection between artists and fans and impose egregious fees while providing minimal value. ticket scalpers use bots and other unfair means to acquire large quantities of face-value tickets and then re-sell them at an enormous markup on the secondary market, price gouging consumers and depriving fans of the opportunity to see their favorite artists without incurring extraordinary expenses. by some reports, fans have paid as much as 70 times face value to obtain a ticket. when this occurs, the artists do not receive any profit. all profits go solely to the scalper and the ticketing agency.

14250,04/03/2025,Addressing Risks From WilmerHale,"14549 vol. 90, no. 63 thursday, april 3, 2025 title 3— executive order 14250 of march 27, 2025 the president addressing risks from wilmerhale by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. background. my administration is committed to addressing the significant risks associated with law firms, particularly so-called ‘‘big law’’ firms, that engage in conduct detrimental to critical american interests. many firms take actions that threaten public safety and national security, limit constitutional freedoms, degrade the quality of american elections, or undermine bedrock american principles. moreover, law firms regularly conduct this harmful activity through their powerful pro bono practices, earmarking hundreds of millions of their clients’ dollars for destructive causes, that often directly or indirectly harm their own clients. lawyers and law firms that engage in such egregious conduct should not have access to our nation’s secrets, nor should such conduct be subsidized by federal taxpayer funds or contracts. wilmer cutler pickering hale and dorr llp (wilmerhale) is yet another law firm that has abandoned the profession’s highest ideals and abused its pro bono practice to engage in activities that undermine justice and the interests of the united states. for example, wilmerhale engages in obvious partisan representations to achieve political ends, supports efforts to discriminate on the basis of race, backs the obstruction of efforts to prevent illegal aliens from committing horrific crimes and trafficking deadly drugs within our borders, and furthers the degradation of the quality of american elections, including by supporting efforts designed to enable non citizens to vote. moreover, wilmerhale itself discriminates against its employ ees based on race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws, including through the use of race-based ‘‘targets.’’ wilmerhale is also bent on employing lawyers who weaponize the prosecu torial power to upend the democratic process and distort justice. for example, wilmerhale rewarded robert mueller and his colleagues—aaron zebley, mueller’s ‘‘top aide’’ and ‘‘closest associate,’’ and james quarles—by wel coming them to the firm after they wielded the power of the federal govern ment to lead one of the most partisan investigations in american history. mueller’s investigation epitomizes the weaponization of government, yet wilmerhale claimed he ‘‘embodies the highest value of our firm and profes sion.’’ mueller’s ‘‘investigation’’ upended the lives of public servants in my administration who were summoned before ‘‘prosecutors’’ with the effect of interfering in their ability to fulfill the mandates of my first term agenda. this weaponization of the justice system must not be rewarded, let alone condoned. sec. 2. security clearance review. (a) the attorney general, the director of national intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applica ble law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at wilmerhale, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.

(c) as soon as practicable, and to the extent permitted by law, all payments made to the federal government shall be processed electronically, except as specified in section 4 of this order. (d) the secretary of state, the secretary of the treasury, the secretary of health and human services, the secretary of education, the secretary of veterans affairs, and the secretary of homeland security shall take appro priate action to eliminate the need for the department of the treasury’s physical lockbox services and expedite requirements to receive the payment of federal receipts, including fees, fines, loans, and taxes, through electronic means except as specified in section 4 of this order. (e) the secretary of the treasury shall support agencies’ transition to digital payment methods, including by providing access through the depart ment of the treasury’s centralized payment systems to: (i) direct deposits; (ii) debit and credit card payments; (iii) digital wallets and real-time payment systems; and 14002 federal register / vol. 90, no. 59 / friday, march 28, 2025 / presidential documents (iv) other modern electronic payment options. sec. 4. exceptions and accommodations for the phase out of paper check disbursements and receipts. (a) the secretary of the treasury, shall review and, as appropriate, revise procedures for granting limited exceptions where electronic payment and collection methods are not feasible, including excep tions for: (i) individuals who do not have access to banking services or electronic payment systems; (ii) certain emergency payments where electronic disbursement would cause undue hardship, as contemplated in 31 c.f.r. part 208; (iii) national security- or law enforcement-related activities where non eft transactions are necessary or desirable; and (iv) other circumstances as determined by the secretary of the treasury, as reflected in regulations or other guidance.

(b) agencies shall coordinate with the department of the treasury to facilitate a smooth transition to digital payments, ensuring that affected individuals and entities receive adequate support. (c) the secretary of the treasury shall work with financial institutions, consumer groups, and other stakeholders to address financial access for unbanked and underbanked populations. (d) the secretary of the treasury and the heads of agencies shall take all necessary steps to protect classified information and systems, as well as personally identifiable information and tax return information, through the implementation of this order. sec. 6. reporting requirements. (a) the heads of agencies shall submit a compliance plan to the director of the office of management and budget within 90 days of the date of this order detailing their strategy for eliminating paper-based transactions. (b) the secretary of the treasury shall submit an implementation report to the president through the assistant to the president for economic policy within 180 days of the date of this order detailing progress on the matters set forth in this order. sec. 7. general provisions.

14248,03/28/2025,Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,"presidential documents executive order 14248 of march 25, 2025 preserving and protecting the integrity of american elections by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose and policy. despite pioneering self-government, the united states now fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections employed by modern, developed nations, as well as those still developing. india and brazil, for example, are tying voter identification to a biometric database, while the united states largely relies on self-attestation for citizenship. in tabulating votes, germany and canada require use of paper ballots, counted in public by local officials, which substantially reduces the number of dis putes as compared to the american patchwork of voting methods that can lead to basic chain-of-custody problems. further, while countries like den mark and sweden sensibly limit mail-in voting to those unable to vote in person and do not count late-arriving votes regardless of the date of postmark, many american elections now feature mass voting by mail, with many officials accepting ballots without postmarks or those received well after election day. free, fair, and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion are fundamental to maintaining our constitutional republic. the right of american citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining the rightful winner of an election. under the constitution, state governments must safeguard american elections in compliance with federal laws that protect americans’ voting rights and guard against dilution by illegal voting, discrimination, fraud, and other forms of malfeasance and error. yet the united states has not adequately enforced federal election requirements that, for example, prohibit states from counting ballots received after election day or prohibit non-citizens from registering to vote. federal law establishes a uniform election day across the nation for federal elections, 2 u.s.c. 7 and 3 u.s.c. 1. it is the policy of my administration to enforce those statutes and require that votes be cast and received by the election date established in law. as the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit recently held in republican national committee v. wetzel (2024), those statutes set ‘‘the day by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials.’’ yet numerous states fail to comply with those laws by counting ballots received after election day. this is like allowing persons who arrive 3 days after election day, perhaps after a winner has been declared, to vote in person at a former voting precinct, which would be absurd. several federal laws, including 18 u.s.c. 1015 and 611, prohibit foreign nationals from registering to vote or voting in federal elections. yet states fail adequately to vet voters’ citizenship, and, in recent years, the department of justice has failed to prioritize and devote sufficient resources for enforcement of these provisions. even worse, the prior administration actively prevented states from removing aliens from their voter lists. additionally, federal laws, such as the national voter registration act (pub. l. 103–31) and the help america vote act (pub. l. 107–252), require states to maintain an accurate and current statewide list of every legally registered voter in the state. and the department of homeland security is required to share database information with states upon request so they 14006 federal register / vol. 90, no. 59 / friday, march 28, 2025 / presidential documents can fulfill this duty. see 8 u.s.c. 1373(c). maintaining accurate voter registra tion lists is a fundamental requirement in protecting voters from having their ballots voided or diluted by fraudulent votes. federal law, 52 u.s.c. 30121, prohibits foreign nationals from participating in federal, state, or local elections by making any contributions or expendi tures. but foreign nationals and non-governmental organizations have taken advantage of loopholes in the law’s interpretation, spending millions of dollars through conduit contributions and ballot-initiative-related expendi tures. this type of foreign interference in our election process undermines the franchise and the right of american citizens to govern their republic. above all, elections must be honest and worthy of the public trust. that requires voting methods that produce a voter-verifiable paper record allowing voters to efficiently check their votes to protect against fraud or mistake. election-integrity standards must be modified accordingly. it is the policy of my administration to enforce federal law and to protect the integrity of our election process. sec. 2. enforcing the citizenship requirement for federal elections. to enforce the federal prohibition on foreign nationals voting in federal elec tions: (a)(i) within 30 days of the date of this order, the election assistance commission shall take appropriate action to require, in its national mail voter registration form issued under 52 u.s.c. 20508: (a) documentary proof of united states citizenship,

(b) to identify unqualified voters registered in the states: (i) the secretary of homeland security shall, consistent with applicable law, ensure that state and local officials have, without the requirement of the payment of a fee, access to appropriate systems for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals registering to vote or who are already registered; (ii) the secretary of state shall take all lawful and appropriate action to make available information from relevant databases to state and local election officials engaged in verifying the citizenship of individuals reg istering to vote or who are already registered; and (iii) the department of homeland security, in coordination with the doge administrator, shall review each state’s publicly available voter registration list and available records concerning voter list maintenance activities as required by 52 u.s.c. 20507, alongside federal immigration databases and state records requested, including through subpoena where necessary and authorized by law, for consistency with federal requirements. (c) within 90 days of the date of this order, the secretary of homeland security shall, consistent with applicable law, provide to the attorney gen eral complete information on all foreign nationals who have indicated on any immigration form that they have registered or voted in a federal, state, or local election, and shall also take all appropriate action to submit to relevant state or local election officials such information. (d) the head of each federal voter registration executive department or agency (agency) under the national voter registration act, 52 u.s.c. 20506(a), shall assess citizenship prior to providing a federal voter registration form to enrollees of public assistance programs. (e) the attorney general shall prioritize enforcement of 18 u.s.c. 611 and 1015(f) and similar laws that restrict non-citizens from registering to vote or voting, including through use of: (i) databases or information maintained by the department of homeland security; (ii) state-issued identification records and driver license databases; and (iii) similar records relating to citizenship. (f) the attorney general shall, consistent with applicable laws, coordinate with state attorneys general to assist with state-level review and prosecution of aliens unlawfully registered to vote or casting votes. sec. 3. providing other assistance to states verifying eligibility. to assist states in determining whether individuals are eligible to register and vote: (a) the commissioner of social security shall take all appropriate action to make available the social security number verification service, the death master file, and any other federal databases containing relevant information to all state and local election officials engaged in verifying the eligibility of individuals registering to vote or who are already registered. in determining and taking such action, the commissioner of social security shall ensure compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations. (b) the attorney general shall ensure compliance with the requirements of 52 u.s.c. 20507(g). (c) the attorney general shall take appropriate action with respect to states that fail to comply with the list maintenance requirements of the national voter registration act and the help america vote act contained in 52 u.s.c. 20507 and 52 u.s.c. 21083. (d) the secretary of defense shall update the federal post card applica tion, pursuant to the uniformed and overseas citizens absentee voting act, 52 u.s.c. 20301, to require: (i) documentary proof of united states citizenship, as defined by section 2(a)(ii) of this order; and (ii) proof of eligibility to vote in elections in the state in which the voter is attempting to vote. sec. 4. improving the election assistance commission. (a) the election assistance commission shall, pursuant to 52 u.s.c. 21003(b)(3) and 21142(c) and consistent with applicable law, take all appropriate action to cease providing federal funds to states that do not comply with the federal laws set forth in 52 u.s.c. 21145, including the requirement in 52 u.s.c. 20505(a)(1) that states accept and use the national mail voter registration form issued pursuant to 52 u.s.c. 20508(a)(1), including any requirement for documentary proof of united states citizenship adopted pursuant to section 2(a)(ii) of this order. (b)(i) the election assistance commission shall initiate appropriate action to amend the voluntary voting system guidelines 2.0 and issue other appro priate guidance establishing standards for voting systems to protect election 14008 federal register / vol. 90, no. 59 / friday, march 28, 2025 / presidential documents integrity. the amended guidelines and other guidance shall provide that voting systems should not use a ballot in which a vote is contained within a barcode or quick-response code in the vote counting process except where necessary to accommodate individuals with disabilities, and should provide a voter-verifiable paper record to prevent fraud or mistake. (ii) within 180 days of the date of this order, the election assistance commission shall take appropriate action to review and, if appropriate, re-certify voting systems under the new standards established under sub section (b)(i) of this section, and to rescind all previous certifications of voting equipment based on prior standards. (c) following an audit of help america vote act fund expenditures con ducted pursuant to 52 u.s.c. 21142, the election assistance commission shall report any discrepancies or issues with an audited state’s certifications of compliance with federal law to the department of justice for appropriate enforcement action. (d) the secretary of homeland security and the administrator of the federal emergency management agency, consistent with applicable law, shall in considering the provision of funding for state or local election offices or administrators through the homeland security grant programs, 6 u.s.c. 603 et seq., heavily prioritize compliance with the voluntary voting system guidelines 2.0 developed by the election assistance commission and completion of testing through the voting system test labs accreditation process. sec. 5. prosecuting election crimes. to protect the franchise of american citizens and their right to participate in fair and honest elections: (a) the attorney general shall take all appropriate action to enter into information-sharing agreements, to the maximum extent possible, with the chief state election official or multi-member agency of each state. these agreements shall aim to provide the department of justice with detailed information on all suspected violations of state and federal election laws discovered by state officials, including information on individuals who: (i) registered or voted despite being ineligible or who registered multiple times; (ii) committed election fraud; (iii) provided false information on voter registration or other election forms; (iv) intimidated or threatened voters or election officials; or (v) otherwise engaged in unlawful conduct to interfere in the election process.

14249,03/28/2025,"Protecting America's Bank Account Against Fraud, Waste, and Abuse","presidential documents executive order 14249 of march 25, 2025 protecting america’s bank account against fraud, waste, and abuse by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. promoting financial integrity and operational efficiency are critical responsibilities of the federal government. the federal govern ment processes trillions of dollars annually in disbursements to individuals, businesses, and organizations, and in receipts from taxes, fees, and other payments to finance daily and long-term government operations. these trans actions flow into and out of the united states general fund (general fund), which might be thought of as america’s bank account. in fiscal year 2024, $33.9 trillion flowed into the general fund and $33.6 trillion flowed out of the account, including $5.87 trillion (less net interest) in benefits, grants, loans, vendor payments, and other disbursements. the department of the treasury is the largest financial payment manager of the federal government and is responsible for safeguarding the general fund, but lacks sufficient controls to track transactions flowing through the general fund to determine if they were proper. to enforce sufficient controls and ensure accountability to american taxpayers, the department of the treasury requires financial information from executive departments and agencies (agencies) beyond what they currently provide. financial fraud threatens the integrity of federal programs and undermines trust in government. agencies’ past underinvestment in technology and longstanding challenges with access to accurate data has prevented them from more fully safeguarding taxpayer dollars against fraud and improper payments. the government accountability office estimates that the federal government loses between $233 and $521 billion annually to fraud. in addition to being an efficient steward of taxpayer funds, the federal government, on behalf of the american public, must seek to ensure that financial information is accurate and that there is transparency with respect to how taxpayer dollars are being used. today, federal funds are disbursed both by the department of the treasury and various federal government entities that are authorized to issue their own disbursements known as non-treasury disbursing offices (ntdos). in fiscal year 2024, ntdos were estimated to be responsible for 181 million payments totaling over $1.5 trillion (approximately 22 percent of all federal government dollars dis bursed). this fragmentation of disbursing authority, together with the pro liferation of non-standard financial management systems across the federal government, leads to expensive, disjointed, and duplicative financial report ing, lack of financial traceability, complicated financial management, opacity, increased operational risks, and decreased ability of the department of the treasury to provide centralized oversight. this order promotes financial integrity by enabling the department of the treasury to more easily conduct improper payment and fraud prevention screening prior to disbursing funds on behalf of agencies. this order increases transparency and accountability by requiring agencies to provide the depart ment of the treasury with the information needed to track transactions through the general fund in greater detail. this order also promotes oper ational efficiency by returning disbursing functions to the department of 14012 federal register / vol. 90, no. 59 / friday, march 28, 2025 / presidential documents the treasury when possible and consolidating and standardizing core federal financial systems. sec. 2. policy. it is the policy of the united states to defend against financial fraud and improper payments, increase transparency and accountability around the federal government’s operations and financial condition, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the security of federal payments. sec. 3. treasury verification of agency payments information. (a) the sec retary of the treasury, in consultation with the director of the office of management and budget (omb director), shall update guidance and enhance systems to ensure that all payments made by the department of the treasury on behalf of agencies pursuant to the secretary of the treasury’s disbursing authority, including 31 u.s.c. 3321, are subject to pre-certification verification processes established by the secretary of the treasury and con ducted by agencies and the department of the treasury for the purposes of defending against financial fraud and improper payments, to the greatest extent permitted by law. such guidance shall set forth guidelines for compli ance with the do not pay working system as described in 31 u.s.c. 3351 et seq., and such other payment, account, and payee validation programs and services that the secretary of the treasury and the omb director deter mine to be beneficial for reducing financial fraud and improper payments. (b) in accordance with 31 u.s.c. 3354, the heads of all agencies shall cooperate with the secretary of the treasury to fulfill their obligations to determine payment or award eligibility through pre-certification and pre award procedures, as determined by the secretary of the treasury, including pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and section 4 of this order to prevent fraud and improper payments. (c) the secretary of the treasury is directed to minimize administrative barriers to accessing and using data to prevent fraud and improper payments by exercising the authority in 31 u.s.c. 3351 et seq. to waive the requirements of 5 u.s.c. 552(o), in consultation with the omb director, in any case or class of cases for computer matching activities, to the extent permissible by law. (d) within 90 days of the date of this order, agency heads shall review and modify, as applicable, their relevant system of records notices under the privacy act of 1974 to include a ‘‘routine use’’ that allows for the disclosure of records to the department of the treasury for the purposes of identifying, preventing, or recouping fraud and improper payments, to the extent permissible by law. (e) the secretary of the treasury, in consultation with the omb director, shall issue guidance to agency heads on the circumstances in which agency heads, to the extent permissible by law, may provide the secretary of the treasury with access to data necessary for the purposes of detecting and preventing fraud and improper payments, as well as data for payment infor mation verification (and not, for example, data such as health records). sec. 4. implementation and compliance of payment verification. (a) agency heads, through designated agency officials (certifying officers or cos), who are responsible for verifying that disbursements made by the federal govern ment are legal, proper, and correct, and for performing the duties in 31 u.s.c. 3528, shall comply with the disbursement requirements and instruc tions, including pre-certification requirements, published by the secretary of the treasury.

(a) the secretary of education shall, to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the department of education and return authority over education to the states and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninter rupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which americans rely. 13680 federal register / vol. 90, no. 56 / tuesday, march 25, 2025 / presidential documents (b) consistent with the department of education’s authorities, the secretary of education shall ensure that the allocation of any federal department of education funds is subject to rigorous compliance with federal law and administration policy, including the requirement that any program or activity receiving federal assistance terminate illegal discrimination obscured under the label ‘‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’’ or similar terms and programs promoting gender ideology. sec. 3. general provisions.

(a) the attorney general, the director of national intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applica ble law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at paul weiss and mark pomerantz, pending a review of whether such clear ances are consistent with the national interest. (b) the office of management and budget shall identify all government goods, property, material, and services, including sensitive compartmented information facilities, provided for the benefit of paul weiss. the heads 13040 federal register / vol. 90, no. 53 / thursday, march 20, 2025 / presidential documents of all agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent per mitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision. sec. 3. contracting.

14235,03/12/2025,Restoring Public Service Loan Forgiveness,"presidential documents executive order 14235 of march 7, 2025 restoring public service loan forgiveness by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. in 2007, the congress established the public service loan forgiveness (pslf) program to encourage americans to enter the public service sector by promising to forgive their remaining student loans after they completed 10 years of service in those jobs while making 10 years of minimum payments. the prior administration abused the pslf program through a waiver process, using taxpayer funds to pay off loans for employees still years away from the statutorily required number of payments. moreover, instead of alleviating worker shortages in necessary occupations, the pslf program has misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and american values, some times through criminal means. the pslf program also creates perverse incentives that can increase the cost of tuition, can load students in low need majors with unsustainable debt, and may push students into organiza tions that hide under the umbrella of a non-profit designation and degrade our national interest, thus requiring additional federal funding to correct the negative societal effects caused by these organizations’ federally sub sidized wrongdoing. as president of the united states, i have a duty to protect, preserve, and defend the constitution and our national security, which includes ending the subsidization of illegal activities, including illegal immigration, human smuggling, child trafficking, pervasive damage to public property, and disrup tion of the public order, which threaten the security and stability of the united states. accordingly, it is the policy of my administration that individ uals employed by organizations whose activities have a substantial illegal purpose shall not be eligible for public service loan forgiveness. sec. 2. restoring public service loan forgiveness. the secretary of education shall propose revisions to 34 cfr 685.219, public service loan forgiveness program, in coordination with the secretary of the treasury as appropriate, that ensure the definition of ‘‘public service’’ excludes organizations that engage in activities that have a substantial illegal purpose, including: (a) aiding or abetting violations of 8 u.s.c. 1325 or other federal immigra tion laws; (b) supporting terrorism, including by facilitating funding to, or the oper ations of, cartels designated as foreign terrorist organizations consistent with 8 u.s.c. 1189, or by engaging in violence for the purpose of obstructing or influencing federal government policy; (c) child abuse, including the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children or the trafficking of children to so-called transgender sanctuary states for purposes of emancipation from their lawful parents, in violation of applicable law; (d) engaging in a pattern of aiding and abetting illegal discrimination; or (e) engaging in a pattern of violating state tort laws, including laws against trespassing, disorderly conduct, public nuisance, vandalism, and obstruction of highways. 11886 federal register / vol. 90, no. 47 / wednesday, march 12, 2025 / presidential documents sec. 3. general provisions.

14230,03/11/2025,Addressing Risks From Perkins Coie LLP,"11781 vol. 90, no. 46 tuesday, march 11, 2025 title 3— executive order 14230 of march 6, 2025 the president addressing risks from perkins coie llp by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. the dishonest and dangerous activity of the law firm perkins coie llp (‘‘perkins coie’’) has affected this country for decades. notably, in 2016 while representing failed presidential candidate hillary clinton, perkins coie hired fusion gps, which then manufactured a false ‘‘dossier’’ designed to steal an election. this egregious activity is part of a pattern. perkins coie has worked with activist donors including george soros to judicially overturn popular, necessary, and democratically enacted election laws, including those requiring voter identification. in one such case, a court was forced to sanction perkins coie attorneys for an unethical lack of candor before the court. in addition to undermining democratic elections, the integrity of our courts, and honest law enforcement, perkins coie racially discriminates against its own attorneys and staff, and against applicants. perkins coie publicly announced percentage quotas in 2019 for hiring and promotion on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws. it proudly excluded applicants on the basis of race for its fellowships, and it maintained these discriminatory practices until applicants harmed by them finally sued to enforce change. my administration is committed to ending discrimination under ‘‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’’ policies and ensuring that federal benefits support the laws and policies of the united states, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. those who engage in blatant race-based and sex-based discrimination, including quotas, but purposefully hide the nature of such discrimination through deceiving language, have engaged in a serious violation of the public trust. their disrespect for the bedrock principle of equality represents good cause to conclude that they neither have access to our nation’s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any federal funds. sec. 2. security clearance review. (a) the attorney general, the director of national intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applica ble law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at perkins coie, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. (b) the office of management and budget shall identify all government goods, property, material, and services, including sensitive compartmented information facilities, provided for the benefit of perkins coie. the heads of all agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent per mitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision. sec. 3. contracting. (a) to prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to federal lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc3 contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, racial discrimina tion, falsified documents designed to weaponize the government against candidates for office, and anti-democratic election changes that invite fraud and distrust, government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require government contractors to disclose any business they do with perkins coie and whether that business is related to the subject of the government contract. 11782 federal register / vol. 90, no. 46 / tuesday, march 11, 2025 / presidential documents (b) the heads of all agencies shall review all contracts with perkins coie or with entities that disclose doing business with perkins coie under subsection (a) of this section. to the extent permitted by law, the heads of agencies shall: (i) take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, including the federal acquisition regulation, for which perkins coie has been hired to perform any service; (ii) otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the united states; with the goals and priorities of my administration as expressed in executive actions, especially executive order 14147 of january 20, 2025 (ending the weaponization of the federal government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate. within 30 days of the date of this order, all agencies shall submit to the director of the office of management and budget an assessment of contracts with perkins coie or with entities that do business with perkins coie effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order. sec. 4. racial discrimination. (a) the chair of the equal employment oppor tunity commission shall review the practices of representative large, influen tial, or industry leading law firms for consistency with title vii of the civil rights act of 1964, including whether large law firms: reserve certain positions, such as summer associate spots, for individuals of preferred races; promote individuals on a discriminatory basis; permit client access on a discriminatory basis; or provide access to events, trainings, or travel on a discriminatory basis. (b) the attorney general, in coordination with the chair of the equal employment opportunity commission and in consultation with state attor neys general as appropriate, shall investigate the practices of large law firms as described in subsection (a) of this section who do business with federal entities for compliance with race-based and sex-based non-discrimi nation laws and take any additional actions the attorney general deems appropriate in light of the evidence uncovered. sec. 5. personnel. (a) the heads of all agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from federal government buildings to employees of perkins coie when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the united states. in addition, the heads of all agencies shall provide guidance limiting government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with perkins coie employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the united states.

(b) the secretary of the treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the ‘‘united states digital asset stockpile,’’ capitalized with all digital assets owned by the department of the treasury, other than btc, that were finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings and that are not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 u.s.c. 9705 or released pursuant lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc6 to subsection (d) of this section (stockpile assets). within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any stockpile assets held by it to the united states digital asset stockpile and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the secretary of the treasury. the secretary of the treasury shall determine strategies for responsible stewardship of the united states digital asset stockpile in accordance with applicable law. 11790 federal register / vol. 90, no. 46 / tuesday, march 11, 2025 / presidential documents (c) the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of commerce shall develop strategies for acquiring additional government btc provided that such strategies are budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on united states taxpayers. however, the united states government shall not acquire additional stockpile assets other than in connection with crimi nal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any agency without further executive or legislative action. (d) ‘‘government digital assets’’ means all government btc and all stock pile assets. the head of each agency shall not sell or otherwise dispose of any government digital assets, except in connection with the secretary of the treasury’s exercise of his lawful authority and responsible stewardship of the united states digital asset stockpile pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, or pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, as required by law, or in cases where the attorney general or other relevant agency head determines that the government digital assets (or the proceeds from the sale or disposition thereof) can and should: (i) be returned to identifiable and verifiable victims of crime; (ii) be used for law enforcement operations; (iii) be equitably shared with state and local law enforcement partners; or (iv) be released to satisfy requirements under 31 u.s.c. 9705, 28 u.s.c. 524(c), 18 u.s.c. 981, or 21 u.s.c. 881. (e) within 60 days of the date of this order, the secretary of the treasury shall deliver an evaluation of the legal and investment considerations for establishing and managing the strategic bitcoin reserve and united states digital asset stockpile going forward, including the accounts in which the strategic bitcoin reserve and united states digital asset stockpile should be located and the need for any legislation to operationalize any aspect of this order or the proper management and administration of such accounts. sec. 4. accounting. within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall provide the secretary of the treasury and the president’s working group on digital asset markets with a full accounting of all govern ment digital assets in such agency’s possession, including any information regarding the custodial accounts in which such government digital assets are currently held that would be necessary to facilitate a transfer of the government digital assets to the strategic bitcoin reserve or the united states digital asset stockpile. if such agency holds no government digital assets, such agency shall confirm such fact to the secretary of the treasury and the president’s working group on digital asset markets within 30 days of the date of this order. sec. 5. general provisions.

(b) in conducting the investigation described in subsection (a) of this section, the secretary of commerce shall assess the factors set forth in khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc 19 u.s.c. 1862(d), labeled ‘‘domestic production for national defense; impact of foreign competition on economic welfare of domestic industries,’’ as well as other relevant factors, including: (i) the current and projected demand for copper in united states defense, energy, and critical infrastructure sectors; (ii) the extent to which domestic production, smelting, refining, and recy cling can meet demand; 11002 federal register / vol. 90, no. 39 / friday, february 28, 2025 / presidential documents (iii) the role of foreign supply chains, particularly from major exporters, in meeting united states demand; (iv) the concentration of united states copper imports from a small number of suppliers and the associated risks; (v) the impact of foreign government subsidies, overcapacity, and predatory trade practices on united states industry competitiveness; (vi) the economic impact of artificially suppressed copper prices due to dumping and state-sponsored overproduction; (vii) the potential for export restrictions by foreign nations, including the ability of foreign nations to weaponize their control over refined copper supplies; (viii) the feasibility of increasing domestic copper mining, smelting, and refining capacity to reduce import reliance; and (ix) the impact of current trade policies on domestic copper production and whether additional measures, including tariffs or quotas, are necessary to protect national security. sec. 3. required actions. (a) the secretary of commerce shall consult with the secretary of defense, the secretary of the interior, the secretary of energy, and the heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies as determined by the secretary of commerce to evaluate the national security risks associated with copper import dependency. (b) within 270 days of the date of this order, the secretary of commerce shall submit a report to the president that includes: (i) findings on whether united states dependence on copper imports threat ens national security; (ii) recommendations on actions to mitigate such threats, including poten tial tariffs, export controls, or incentives to increase domestic production; and (iii) policy recommendations for strengthening the united states copper supply chain through strategic investments, permitting reforms, and en hanced recycling initiatives. sec. 4. general provisions.

health plans to post their negotiated rates with providers as well as their out-of-network payments to providers and the actual prices they or their pharmacy benefit manager pay for prescription drugs; and health plans to maintain a consumer-facing internet tool through which individuals can access price information. one economic analysis from 2023 estimated the impact of these regulations, if fully implemented, could result in as much as $80 billion in healthcare savings for consumers, employers, and insurers by 2025. another report from 2024 suggested healthcare price transparency could help employers reduce healthcare costs by 27 percent across 500 common healthcare services. recent data has found the top 25 percent of most expensive healthcare service prices have dropped by 6.3 percent per year following the initial implementation of price transparency during my first term. unfortunately, progress on price transparency at the federal level has stalled since the end of my first term. hospitals and health plans were not adequately held to account when their price transparency data was incomplete or not even posted at all. the biden administration failed to take sufficient steps to fully enforce my administration’s requirement that would end the opaque nature of drug prices by ensuring health plans publicly post the true prices they pay for prescription drugs. the american people deserve better. making america healthy again will khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc2 require empowering individuals with the best information possible to inform their life and healthcare choices. by building on the historic efforts of my first term, my administration will make more meaningful price informa tion available to patients to support a more competitive, innovative, afford able, and higher quality healthcare system. sec. 2. policy. it is the policy of the united states to put patients first and ensure they have the information they need to make well-informed 11006 federal register / vol. 90, no. 39 / friday, february 28, 2025 / presidential documents healthcare decisions. the federal government will continue to promote universal access to clear and accurate healthcare prices and will take all necessary steps to improve existing price transparency requirements; increase enforcement of price transparency requirements; and identify opportunities to further empower patients with meaningful price information, potentially including through the expansion of existing price transparency requirements. sec. 3. fulfilling the promise of radical transparency. the secretary of the treasury, the secretary of labor, and the secretary of health and human services shall take all necessary and appropriate action to rapidly implement and enforce the healthcare price transparency regulations issued pursuant to executive order 13877, including, within 90 days of the date of this order, action to: (a) require the disclosure of the actual prices of items and services, not estimates; (b) issue updated guidance or proposed regulatory action ensuring pricing information is standardized and easily comparable across hospitals and health plans; and (c) issue guidance or proposed regulatory action updating enforcement policies designed to ensure compliance with the transparent reporting of complete, accurate, and meaningful data. sec. 4. general provisions. (a) nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the director of the office of management and budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(fcpa) has been systemati cally, and to a steadily increasing degree, stretched beyond proper bounds and abused in a manner that harms the interests of the united states. current fcpa enforcement impedes the united states’ foreign policy objec tives and therefore implicates the president’s article ii authority over foreign affairs. the president’s foreign policy authority is inextricably linked with the global economic competitiveness of american companies. american national secu rity depends in substantial part on the united states and its companies gaining strategic business advantages whether in critical minerals, deep water ports, or other key infrastructure or assets. but overexpansive and unpredictable fcpa enforcement against american citizens and businesses—by our own government—for routine business prac tices in other nations not only wastes limited prosecutorial resources that could be dedicated to preserving american freedoms, but actively harms american economic competitiveness and, therefore, national security. it is therefore the policy of my administration to preserve the presidential authority to conduct foreign affairs and advance american economic and national security by eliminating excessive barriers to american commerce abroad. sec. 2. policy of enforcement discretion. (a) for a period of 180 days following the date of this order, the attorney general shall review guidelines and policies governing investigations and enforcement actions under the fcpa. during the review period, the attorney general shall: (i) cease initiation of any new fcpa investigations or enforcement actions, unless the attorney general determines that an individual exception should be made; (ii) review in detail all existing fcpa investigations or enforcement actions and take appropriate action with respect to such matters to restore proper bounds on fcpa enforcement and preserve presidential foreign policy prerogatives; and (iii) issue updated guidelines or policies, as appropriate, to adequately promote the president’s article ii authority to conduct foreign affairs and prioritize american interests, american economic competitiveness with respect to other nations, and the efficient use of federal law enforcement resources. khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc4 (b) the attorney general may extend such review period for an additional 180 days as the attorney general determines appropriate.

(a) as president of the united states, my highest duty is the defense of the country and its citizens. a nation without borders is not a nation at all. i will not stand by and allow our sovereignty to be eroded, our laws to be trampled, our citizens to be endangered, or our borders to be disrespected anymore. i previously declared a national emergency with respect to the grave threat to the united states posed by the influx of illegal aliens and illicit drugs into the united states in proclamation 10886 of january 20, 2025 (declaring a national emergency at the southern border). pursuant to the nea, i hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in that proclama tion to cover the threat to the safety and security of americans, including the public health crisis of deaths due to the use of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of canada to do more to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept dtos, other drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs. in addition, this failure to act on the part of canada constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the united states, to the national security and foreign policy of the united states. i hereby declare and reiterate a national emer gency under the nea and ieepa to deal with that threat. this national emergency requires decisive and immediate action, and i have decided to impose, consistent with law, ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of canada set forth in this order. in doing so, i invoke my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(b) of ieepa, and specifically find that action under other authority to impose tariffs is inadequate to address this unusual and extraor dinary threat. sec. 2.

14195,02/07/2025,Imposing Duties To Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People's Republic of China,"presidential documents executive order 14195 of february 1, 2025 imposing duties to address the synthetic opioid supply chain in the people’s republic of china by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, including the international emergency economic powers act (50 u.s.c. 1701 et seq.) (ieepa), the national emer gencies act (50 u.s.c. 1601 et seq.) (nea), section 604 of the trade act of 1974, as amended (19 u.s.c. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, united states code, i, donald j. trump, president of the united states of america, find that the sustained influx of synthetic opioids has profound consequences on our nation, including by killing approximately two hundred americans per day, putting a severe strain on our healthcare system, ravaging our communities, and destroying our families. synthetic opioid overdose is the leading cause of death for people aged 18 to 45 in the united states. during my first term, i took steps to end the direct flow of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids from the people’s republic of china (prc) to the united states. since then, the chinese communist party (ccp), which exerts ultimate control over the government and enterprises of the prc, has sub sidized and otherwise incentivized prc chemical companies to export fentanyl and related precursor chemicals that are used to produce synthetic opioids sold illicitly in the united states. furthermore, the prc provides support to and safe haven for prc-origin transnational criminal organizations (tcos) that launder the revenues from the production, shipment, and sale of illicit synthetic opioids. these prc origin tcos coordinate and communicate using prc social media software applications in the conduct of their business. many prc-based chemical companies also go to great lengths to evade law enforcement and hide illicit substances in the flow of legitimate com merce. some of the techniques employed by these prc-based companies to conceal the true contents of the parcels and the identity of the distributors include the use of re-shippers in the united states, false invoices, fraudulent postage, and deceptive packaging. while more than 500,000 pounds of drugs have been seized at the southern border each of the last 3 fiscal years, in addition, more than 42,000 pounds of drugs have been seized at the northern border each year on average over the last 3 years. illicit drugs kill tens of thousands of americans each year, including 75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone. the influx of these drugs to our nation threatens the fabric of our society. the prc plays a central role in this challenge, not merely by failing to stem the ultimate source of many illicit drugs distributed in the united states, but by actively sustaining and expanding the business of poisoning our citizens. lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc2 the flow of contraband drugs like fentanyl to the united states through illicit distribution networks has created a national emergency, including a public health crisis in the united states, as outlined in the presidential memorandum of january 20, 2025 (america first trade policy), proclamation 10886 of january 20, 2025 (declaring a national emergency at the southern border of the united states), and executive order 14157 of january 20, 9122 federal register / vol. 90, no. 25 / friday, february 7, 2025 / presidential documents 2025 (designating cartels and other organizations as foreign terrorist orga nizations and specially designated global terrorists). despite multiple attempts to resolve this crisis at its root source through bilateral dialogue, prc officials have failed to follow through with the deci sive actions needed to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to known criminal cartels and shut down the money laundering tcos. the prc imple ments the most sophisticated domestic surveillance network coupled with the most comprehensive domestic law enforcement apparatus in the world. the prc also routinely exerts extraterritorial reach across the globe to threat en, harass, and suppress what it views as political dissent. as such, the ccp does not lack the capacity to severely blunt the global illicit opioid epidemic; it simply is unwilling to do so. immediate action is required to address the national emergency i declared and to finally end this emergency, including the public health crisis caused by opioid use and addiction, which will not happen until the full compliance and cooperation of the prc government is assured. i hereby determine and order: section 1. (a) as president of the united states, my highest duty is the defense of the country and its citizens. i will not stand by and allow our citizens to be poisoned, our laws to be trampled, our communities to be ravaged, or our families to be destroyed. i previously declared a national emergency with respect to the grave threat to the united states posed by the influx of illegal aliens and drugs into the united states in proclamation 10886. pursuant to the nea, i hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in that proclamation to cover the failure of the prc government to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept chemical precursor suppliers, money launderers, other tcos, crimi nals at large, and drugs. in addition, this failure to act constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the united states, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the united states. i hereby declare and reiterate a national emergency under the nea and ieepa to deal with that threat. this national emergency requires decisive and immediate action, and i have decided to impose, consistent with law, ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of the prc as set forth in this order. in doing so, i invoke my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(b) of ieepa, and specifically find that action under other authority to impose tariffs is inadequate to address this unusual and extraordinary threat. sec. 2. (a) all articles that are products of the prc, as defined by the register notice), shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty. such rate of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for con sumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on february 4, 2025, except that goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for con sumption, after such time that were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the united states before 12:01 a.m. eastern time on february 1, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty, only if the importer certifies to u.s. customs and border protection within the department of homeland security as specified in the federal register notice. lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc2 (b) the rates of duty established by this order are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, or charges applicable to such imported articles.

(b) the term ‘‘pediatric’’ means relating to the medical care of a child.

14190,02/03/2025,Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,"presidential documents executive order 14190 of january 29, 2025 ending radical indoctrination in k–12 schooling by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose and policy. parents trust america’s schools to provide their children with a rigorous education and to instill a patriotic admiration for our incredible nation and the values for which we stand. in recent years, however, parents have witnessed schools indoctrinate their children in radical, anti-american ideologies while deliberately blocking parental oversight. such an environment operates as an echo chamber, in which students are forced to accept these ideologies without question or critical examination. in many cases, innocent children are compelled to adopt identities as either victims or oppressors solely based on their skin color and other immutable characteristics. in other instances, young men and women are made to question whether they were born in the wrong body and whether to view their parents and their reality as enemies to be blamed. these practices not only erode critical thinking but also sow division, confusion, and distrust, which undermine the very foundations of personal identity and family unity. imprinting anti-american, subversive, harmful, and false ideologies on our nation’s children not only violates longstanding anti-discrimination civil rights law in many cases, but usurps basic parental authority. for example, steering students toward surgical and chemical mutilation without parental consent or involvement or allowing males access to private spaces designated for females may contravene federal laws that protect parental rights, includ ing the family educational rights and privacy act (ferpa) and the protec tion of pupil rights amendment (ppra), and sex-based equality and oppor tunity, including title ix of the education amendments of 1972 (title ix). similarly, demanding acquiescence to ‘‘white privilege’’ or ‘‘unconscious bias,’’ actually promotes racial discrimination and undermines national unity. my administration will enforce the law to ensure that recipients of federal funds providing k–12 education comply with all applicable laws prohibiting discrimination in various contexts and protecting parental rights, including title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 (title vi), 42 u.s.c. 2000d et seq.; title ix, 20 u.s.c. 1681 et seq.; ferpa, 20 u.s.c. 1232g; and the ppra, 20 u.s.c. 1232h. sec. 2. definitions. as used herein: (a) the definitions in the executive order ‘‘defending women from gender ideology extremism and restoring biological truth to the federal govern ment’’ (january 20, 2025) shall apply to this order.

(c) ‘‘educational service agency’’ (esa) has the meaning given in 20 u.s.c. 1401(5), and the terms ‘‘elementary school,’’ ‘‘local educational agency’’ (lea), ‘‘secondary school,’’ and ‘‘state educational agency’’ (sea) have the meanings given in 34 cfr 77.1(c). (d) ‘‘patriotic education’’ means a presentation of the history of america grounded in: (i) an accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling characterization of america’s founding and foundational principles; (ii) a clear examination of how the united states has admirably grown closer to its noble principles throughout its history; (iii) the concept that commitment to america’s aspirations is beneficial and justified; and (iv) the concept that celebration of america’s greatness and history is proper. (e) ‘‘social transition’’ means the process of adopting a ‘‘gender identity’’ or ‘‘gender marker’’ that differs from a person’s sex. this process can include psychological or psychiatric counseling or treatment by a school counselor or other provider; modifying a person’s name (e.g., ‘‘jane’’ to ‘‘james’’) or pronouns (e.g., ‘‘him’’ to ‘‘her’’); calling a child ‘‘nonbinary’’; use of intimate facilities and accommodations such as bathrooms or locker rooms specifically designated for persons of the opposite sex; and participating in school athletic competitions or other extracurricular activities specifically designated for persons of the opposite sex. ‘‘social transition’’ does not include chemical or surgical mutilation. sec. 3. ending indoctrination strategy.

14191,02/03/2025,Expanding Educational Freedom and Opportunity for Families,"presidential documents executive order 14191 of january 29, 2025 expanding educational freedom and opportunity for fami lies by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, and to improve the education, well being, and future success of america’s most prized resource, her young citizens, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. parents want and deserve the best education for their children. but too many children do not thrive in their assigned, government run k–12 school. according to this year’s national assessment of educational progress (naep), 70 percent of 8th graders were below proficient in reading, and 72 percent were below proficient in math. moreover, geographically based school assignments exacerbate the cost of housing in districts with preferred schools, straining the finances of millions of american families sacrificing for their children’s futures. when our public education system fails such a large segment of society, it hinders our national competitiveness and devastates families and commu nities. for this reason, more than a dozen states have enacted universal k–12 scholarship programs, allowing families—rather than the government— to choose the best educational setting for their children. these states have highlighted the most promising avenue for education reform: educational choice for families and competition for residentially assigned, government run public schools. the growing body of rigorous research demonstrates that well-designed education-freedom programs improve student achievement and cause nearby public schools to improve their performance. sec. 2. policy. it is the policy of my administration to support parents in choosing and directing the upbringing and education of their children. sec. 3. guidance on supporting state-based k–12 educational choice. within 60 days of the date of this order, the secretary of education shall issue guidance regarding how states can use federal formula funds to support k–12 educational choice initiatives. sec. 4. encouraging education freedom through discretionary grant pro grams.

14183,02/03/2025,Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness,"presidential documents executive order 14183 of january 27, 2025 prioritizing military excellence and readiness by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, and as commander in chief of the armed forces of the united states, and to ensure the readiness and effective ness of our armed forces, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. the united states military has a clear mission: to protect the american people and our homeland as the world’s most lethal and effective fighting force. success in this existential mission requires a singular focus on developing the requisite warrior ethos, and the pursuit of military excellence cannot be diluted to accommodate political agendas or other ideologies harmful to unit cohesion. recently, however, the armed forces have been afflicted with radical gender ideology to appease activists unconcerned with the requirements of military service like physical and mental health, selflessness, and unit cohesion. longstanding department of defense (dod) policy (dod instruction (dodi) 6130.03) provides that it is the policy of the dod to ensure that service members are ‘‘[f]ree of medical conditions or physical defects that may reasonably be expected to require excessive time lost from duty for necessary treatment or hospitalization.’’ as a result, many mental and physical health conditions are incompatible with active duty, from conditions that require substantial medication or medical treatment to bipolar and related disorders, eating disorders, suicidality, and prior psychiatric hospitalization. consistent with the military mission and longstanding dod policy, expressing a false ‘‘gender identity’’ divergent from an individual’s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service. beyond the hormonal and surgical medical interventions involved, adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life. a man’s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member. for the sake of our nation and the patriotic americans who volunteer to serve it, military service must be reserved for those mentally and physically fit for duty. the armed forces must adhere to high mental and physical health standards to ensure our military can deploy, fight, and win, including in austere conditions and without the benefit of routine medical treatment or special provisions. sec. 2. policy. it is the policy of the united states government to establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity. this policy is inconsistent with the medical, sur gical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria. this policy is also inconsistent with shifting pronoun usage or use of prokhammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdoc3 nouns that inaccurately reflect an individual’s sex. sec. 3. definitions. the definitions in the executive order of january 20, 2025 (defending women from gender ideology extremism and restoring biological truth to the federal government) shall apply to this order. sec. 4. implementation.

(a) pursuant to the executive order of january 20, 2025 (initial rescissions of harmful executive orders and actions), executive order 14004 of january 25, 2021 (enabling all qualified americans to serve their country in uniform), has been revoked. accordingly, all policies, directives, and guidance issued pursuant to executive order 14004 shall be rescinded to the extent incon sistent with the provisions of this order.

(a) within seven days of the date of this order, each agency head with authority to appoint members to the board on geographic names (board) pursuant to 43 u.s.c. 364a, shall review their respective appointees and consider replacing those appointees in accordance with applicable law. (b) the secretary of the interior shall review and consider additional appointments to the board to assist in fulfilling all aspects of this order, subject to all applicable laws. (c) with respect to all applications for naming and renaming submitted to the newly constituted board, the board shall advance the policy estab lished in section 1 of this order to honor the contributions of visionary and patriotic americans and may update its principles, policies, and proce dures as needed to achieve this policy. (d) where congressional action is required to establish a renaming in public law, following board approval on renaming, the board shall provide guidance to all relevant federal agencies to use the board-approved name in the interim in federal documents and achieve consistency across the federal government. sec. 3. renaming of mount mckinley. (a) president william mckinley, the 25th president of the united states, heroically led our nation to victory in the spanish-american war. under his leadership, the united states en joyed rapid economic growth and prosperity, including an expansion of territorial gains for the nation. president mckinley championed tariffs to protect u.s. manufacturing, boost domestic production, and drive u.s. indus trialization and global reach to new heights. he was tragically assassinated in an attack on our nation’s values and our success, and he should be honored for his steadfast commitment to american greatness. in 1917, the country officially honored president mckinley through the naming of north america’s highest peak. yet after nearly a century, president obama’s administration, in 2015, stripped the mckinley name from federal nomenclature, an affront to president mckinley’s life, his achievements, and his sacrifice. this order honors president mckinley for giving his life for our great nation and dutifully recognizes his historic legacy of protecting america’s interests and generating enormous wealth for all americans. (b) within 30 days of the date of this order, the secretary of the interior shall, consistent with 43 u.s.c. 364 through 364f, reinstate the name ‘‘mount mckinley.’’ the secretary shall subsequently update the geographic names information system (gnis) to reflect the renaming and reinstatement of 8630 federal register / vol. 90, no. 20 / friday, january 31, 2025 / presidential documents mount mckinley. the national park area surrounding mount mckinley shall retain the name denali national park and preserve.

(a) the area formerly known as the gulf of mexico has long been an integral asset to our once burgeoning nation and has remained an indelible part of america. the gulf was a crucial artery for america’s early trade and global commerce. it is the largest gulf in the world, and the united states coastline along this remarkable body of water spans over 1,700 miles and contains nearly 160 million acres. its natural resources and wildlife remain central to america’s economy today. the bountiful geology of this basin has made it one of the most prodigious oil and gas regions in the world, providing roughly 14% of our nation’s crude-oil production and an abundance of natural gas, and consistently driving new and innovative technologies that have allowed us to tap into some of the deepest and richest oil reservoirs in the world. the gulf is also home to vibrant american fisheries teeming with snapper, shrimp, grouper, stone crab, and other species, and it is recognized as one of the most productive fisheries in the world, with the second largest volume of commercial fishing landings by region in the nation, contributing millions of dollars to local american economies. the gulf is also a favorite destination for american tourism and recreation activities. further, the gulf is a vital region for the multi-billion-dollar u.s. maritime industry, providing some of the largest and most impressive ports in the world. the gulf will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping america’s future and the global economy, and in recognition of this flourishing economic resource and its critical importance to our nation’s economy and its people, i am directing that it officially be renamed the gulf of america. (b) as such, within 30 days of the date of this order, the secretary of the interior shall, consistent with 43 u.s.c. 364 through 364f, take all appropriate actions to rename as the ‘‘gulf of america’’ the u.s. continental shelf area bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the states of texas, louisiana, mississippi, alabama and florida and extending to the seaward boundary with mexico and cuba in the area formerly named as the gulf of mexico. the secretary shall subsequently update the gnis to reflect the renaming of the gulf and remove all references to the gulf of mexico from the gnis, consistent with applicable law. the board shall provide guidance to ensure all federal references to the gulf of america, including on agency maps, contracts, and other documents and communica tions shall reflect its renaming. sec. 5. additional action. the secretary of interior may solicit public and intergovernmental input regarding additional patriots to honor, particularly in light of america’s semiquincentennial celebration, and shall recommend action to me, through the assistant to the president for domestic policy. sec. 6. general provisions.

14173,01/31/2025,Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,"presidential documents executive order 14173 of january 21, 2025 ending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. longstanding federal civil-rights laws protect individual americans from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. these civil-rights protections serve as a bedrock supporting equality of opportunity for all americans. as president, i have a solemn duty to ensure that these laws are enforced for the benefit of all americans. yet today, roughly 60 years after the passage of the civil rights act of 1964, critical and influential institutions of american society, including the federal government, major corporations, financial institutions, the med ical industry, large commercial airlines, law enforcement agencies, and insti tutions of higher education have adopted and actively use dangerous, de meaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called ‘‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’’ (dei) or ‘‘diversity, equity, inclu sion, and accessibility’’ (deia) that can violate the civil-rights laws of this nation. illegal dei and deia policies not only violate the text and spirit of our longstanding federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional american values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system. hard working americans who deserve a shot at the american dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex. these illegal dei and deia policies also threaten the safety of american men, women, and children across the nation by diminishing the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination when selecting people for jobs and services in key sectors of american society, including all levels of government, and the medical, aviation, and law-enforcement communities. yet in case after tragic case, the american people have wit nessed first-hand the disastrous consequences of illegal, pernicious discrimi nation that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing. the federal government is charged with enforcing our civil-rights laws. the purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination. sec. 2. policy. it is the policy of the united states to protect the civil rights of all americans and to promote individual initiative, excellence, and hard work. i therefore order all executive departments and agencies (agencies) to terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs, activities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, con sent orders, and requirements. i further order all agencies to enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector dei pref erences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities. sec. 3. terminating illegal discrimination in the federal government.

14168,01/30/2025,Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,"presidential documents executive order 14168 of january 20, 2025 defending women from gender ideology extremism and re storing biological truth to the federal government by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, including section 7301 of title 5, united states code, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. across the country, ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women’s domestic abuse shelters to women’s workplace showers. this is wrong. efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being. the erasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women but on the validity of the entire american system. basing federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself. this unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful attack against the ordinary and longstanding use and understanding of biological and scientific terms, replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts. invalidating the true and biological category of ‘‘woman’’ improperly trans forms laws and policies designed to protect sex-based opportunities into laws and policies that undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept. accordingly, my administration will defend women’s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male. sec. 2. policy and definitions. it is the policy of the united states to recognize two sexes, male and female. these sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality. under my direc tion, the executive branch will enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality, and the following definitions shall govern all executive interpre tation of and application of federal law and administration policy: (a) ‘‘sex’’ shall refer to an individual’s immutable biological classification as either male or female. ‘‘sex’’ is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of ‘‘gender identity.’’ (b) ‘‘women’’ or ‘‘woman’’ and ‘‘girls’’ or ‘‘girl’’ shall mean adult and juvenile human females, respectively. (c) ‘‘men’’ or ‘‘man’’ and ‘‘boys’’ or ‘‘boy’’ shall mean adult and juvenile human males, respectively. (d) ‘‘female’’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc13 produces the large reproductive cell. (e) ‘‘male’’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that pro duces the small reproductive cell. (f) ‘‘gender ideology’’ replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true. 8616 federal register / vol. 90, no. 19 / thursday, january 30, 2025 / presidential documents gender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one’s sex. gender ideology is internally incon sistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body. (g) ‘‘gender identity’’ reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an infinite continuum, that does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex. sec. 3. recognizing women are biologically distinct from men. (a) within 30 days of the date of this order, the secretary of health and human services shall provide to the u.s. government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order. (b) each agency and all federal employees shall enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes. each agency should therefore give the terms ‘‘sex’’, ‘‘male’’, ‘‘female’’, ‘‘men’’, ‘‘women’’, ‘‘boys’’ and ‘‘girls’’ the meanings set forth in section 2 of this order when interpreting or applying statutes, regulations, or guidance and in all other official agency business, documents, and communications. (c) when administering or enforcing sex-based distinctions, every agency and all federal employees acting in an official capacity on behalf of their agency shall use the term ‘‘sex’’ and not ‘‘gender’’ in all applicable federal policies and documents. (d) the secretaries of state and homeland security, and the director of the office of personnel management, shall implement changes to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and global entry cards, accurately reflect the holder’s sex, as defined under section 2 of this order; and the director of the office of personnel manage ment shall ensure that applicable personnel records accurately report federal employees’ sex, as defined by section 2 of this order. (e) agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, com munications, or other internal and external messages that promote or other wise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages. agency forms that require an individual’s sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity. agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the federal funding of gender ideology. (f) the prior administration argued that the supreme court’s decision in bostock v. clayton county (2020), which addressed title vii of the civil rights act of 1964, requires gender identity-based access to single sex spaces under, for example, title ix of the educational amendments act. this position is legally untenable and has harmed women. the attorney general shall therefore immediately issue guidance to agencies to correct the misapplication of the supreme court’s decision in bostock v. clayton county (2020) to sex-based distinctions in agency activities. in addition, the attorney general shall issue guidance and assist agencies in protecting sex-based distinctions, which are explicitly permitted under constitutional and statutory precedent. (g) federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology. each lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc13 agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology. sec. 4. privacy in intimate spaces. (a) the attorney general and secretary of homeland security shall ensure that males are not detained in women’s prisons or housed in women’s detention centers, including through amend ment, as necessary, of part 115.41 of title 28, code of federal regulations and interpretation guidance regarding the americans with disabilities act. (b) the secretary of housing and urban development shall prepare and submit for notice and comment rulemaking a policy to rescind the final rule entitled ‘‘equal access in accordance with an individual’s gender identity in community planning and development programs’’ of september 21, 2016, 81 fr 64763, and shall submit for public comment a policy protecting women seeking single-sex rape shelters. (c) the attorney general shall ensure that the bureau of prisons revises its policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order, and shall ensure that no federal funds are expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex. (d) agencies shall effectuate this policy by taking appropriate action to ensure that intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are designated by sex and not identity. sec. 5. protecting rights. the attorney general shall issue guidance to ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by the civil rights act of 1964. in accordance with that guidance, the attorney general, the secretary of labor, the general counsel and chair of the equal employment opportunity commission, and each other agency head with enforcement responsibilities under the civil rights act shall prioritize inves tigations and litigation to enforce the rights and freedoms identified. sec. 6. bill text. within 30 days of the date of this order, the assistant to the president for legislative affairs shall present to the president proposed bill text to codify the definitions in this order. sec. 7. agency implementation and reporting. (a) within 120 days of the date of this order, each agency head shall submit an update on implementa tion of this order to the president, through the director of the office of management and budget. that update shall address: (i) changes to agency documents, including regulations, guidance, forms, and communications, made to comply with this order; and (ii) agency-imposed requirements on federally funded entities, including contractors, to achieve the policy of this order. (b) the requirements of this order supersede conflicting provisions in any previous executive orders or presidential memoranda, including but not limited to executive orders 13988 of january 20, 2021, 14004 of january 25, 2021, 14020 and 14021 of march 8, 2021, and 14075 of june 15, 2022. these executive orders are hereby rescinded, and the white house gender policy council established by executive order 14020 is dissolved. (c) each agency head shall promptly rescind all guidance documents incon sistent with the requirements of this order or the attorney general’s guidance issued pursuant to this order, or rescind such parts of such documents that are inconsistent in such manner. such documents include, but are not limited to: (i) ‘‘the white house toolkit on transgender equality’’; (ii) the department of education’s guidance documents including: (a) ‘‘2024 title ix regulations: pointers for implementation’’ (july 2024); (b) ‘‘u.s. department of education toolkit: creating inclusive and non discriminatory school environments for lgbtqi+ students’’; (c) ‘‘u.s. department of education supporting lgbtqi+ youth and lotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc13 families in school’’ (june 21, 2023); (d) ‘‘departamento de educación de ee.uu. apoyar a los jóvenes y familias lgbtqi+ en la escuela’’ (june 21, 2023); (e) ‘‘supporting intersex students: a resource for students, families, and educators’’ (october 2021); (f) ‘‘supporting transgender youth in school’’ (june 2021); 8618 federal register / vol. 90, no. 19 / thursday, january 30, 2025 / presidential documents (g) ‘‘letter to educators on title ix’s 49th anniversary’’ (june 23, 2021); (h) ‘‘confronting anti-lgbtqi+ harassment in schools: a resource for students and families’’ (june 2021); (i) ‘‘enforcement of title ix of the education amendments of 1972 with respect to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in light of bostock v. clayton county’’ (june 22, 2021); (j) ‘‘education in a pandemic: the disparate impacts of covid–19 on america’s students’’ (june 9, 2021); and (k) ‘‘back-to-school message for transgender students from the u.s. depts of justice, education, and hhs’’ (aug. 17, 2021); (iii) the attorney general’s memorandum of march 26, 2021 entitled ‘‘ap plication of bostock v. clayton county to title ix of the education amend ments of 1972’’; and (iv) the equal employment opportunity commission’s ‘‘enforcement guid ance on harassment in the workplace’’ (april 29, 2024). sec. 8. general provisions.

(a) the attorney general shall pursue the death penalty for all crimes of a severity demanding its use. (b) in addition to pursuing the death penalty where possible, the attorney general shall, where consistent with applicable law, pursue federal jurisdiclotter on dsk11xqn23prod with fr_prezdoc3 tion and seek the death penalty regardless of other factors for every federal capital crime involving: (i) the murder of a law-enforcement officer; or (ii) a capital crime committed by an alien illegally present in this country. the attorney general shall encourage state attorneys general and district attorneys to bring state capital charges for all capital crimes with special 8464 federal register / vol. 90, no. 19 / thursday, january 30, 2025 / presidential documents attention to the crimes described in subsections (i) and (ii), regardless of whether the federal trial results in a capital sentence. (d) the attorney general shall take all appropriate action to modify the justice manual based on the policy and purpose set forth in this executive order. (e) the attorney general shall evaluate the places of imprisonment and conditions of confinement for each of the 37 murderers whose federal death sentences were commuted by president biden, and the attorney gen eral shall take all lawful and appropriate action to ensure that these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose. the attorney general shall further evaluate wheth er these offenders can be charged with state capital crimes and shall rec ommend appropriate action to state and local authorities. sec. 4. preserving capital punishment in the states. (a) the attorney general shall take all necessary and lawful action to ensure that each state that allows capital punishment has a sufficient supply of drugs needed to carry out lethal injection. (b) the attorney general shall take all appropriate action to approve or deny any pending request for certification made by any state under 28 u.s.c. 2265. sec. 5. seeking the overruling of supreme court precedents that hinder capital punishment. the attorney general shall take all appropriate action to seek the overruling of supreme court precedents that limit the authority of state and federal governments to impose capital punishment. sec. 6. prosecuting crime to protect communities. (a) the attorney general shall appropriately prioritize public safety and the prosecution of violent crime, and take all appropriate action necessary to dismantle transnational criminal activity in the united states. (b) to ensure the fullest protection of american communities from vio lence, the attorney general shall encourage state attorneys general and dis trict attorneys to adopt policies and practices aligned with subsection (a). federal law enforcement should coordinate with state and local law enforce ment where possible to facilitate these objectives. sec. 7. general provisions.

14156,01/29/2025,Declaring a National Energy Emergency,"8433 vol. 90, no. 18 wednesday, january 29, 2025 title 3— executive order 14156 of january 20, 2025 the president declaring a national energy emergency by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, including the national emergencies act (50 u.s.c. 1601 et seq.) (‘‘nea’’), and section 301 of title 3, united states code, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. the energy and critical minerals (‘‘energy’’) identification, leasing, development, production, transportation, refining, and generation capacity of the united states are all far too inadequate to meet our nation’s needs. we need a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our nation’s manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness. caused by the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administra tion, our nation’s inadequate energy supply and infrastructure causes and makes worse the high energy prices that devastate americans, particularly those living on low- and fixed-incomes. this active threat to the american people from high energy prices is exacer bated by our nation’s diminished capacity to insulate itself from hostile foreign actors. energy security is an increasingly crucial theater of global competition. in an effort to harm the american people, hostile state and non-state foreign actors have targeted our domestic energy infrastructure, weaponized our reliance on foreign energy, and abused their ability to cause dramatic swings within international commodity markets. an afford able and reliable domestic supply of energy is a fundamental requirement for the national and economic security of any nation. the integrity and expansion of our nation’s energy infrastructure—from coast to coast—is an immediate and pressing priority for the protection of the united states’ national and economic security. it is imperative that the federal government puts the physical and economic wellbeing of the american people first. moreover, the united states has the potential to use its unrealized energy resources domestically, and to sell to international allies and partners a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy. this would create jobs and economic prosperity for americans forgotten in the present econ omy, improve the united states’ trade balance, help our country compete with hostile foreign powers, strengthen relations with allies and partners, and support international peace and security. accordingly, our nation’s dangerous energy situation inflicts unnecessary and perilous constraints on our foreign policy. the policies of the previous administration have driven our nation into a national emergency, where a precariously inadequate and intermittent energy supply, and an increasingly unreliable grid, require swift and decisive khammond on dsk9w7s144prod with presdocb action. without immediate remedy, this situation will dramatically deterio rate in the near future due to a high demand for energy and natural resources to power the next generation of technology. the united states’ ability to remain at the forefront of technological innovation depends on a reliable supply of energy and the integrity of our nation’s electrical grid. our nation’s current inadequate development of domestic energy resources leaves us vul nerable to hostile foreign actors and poses an imminent and growing threat to the united states’ prosperity and national security. 8434 federal register / vol. 90, no. 18 / wednesday, january 29, 2025 / presidential documents these numerous problems are most pronounced in our nation’s northeast and west coast, where dangerous state and local policies jeopardize our nation’s core national defense and security needs, and devastate the pros perity of not only local residents but the entire united states population. the united states’ insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our na tion’s economy, national security, and foreign policy. in light of these find ings, i hereby declare a national emergency. sec. 2. emergency approvals. (a) the heads of executive departments and agencies (‘‘agencies’’) shall identify and exercise any lawful emergency au thorities available to them, as well as all other lawful authorities they may possess, to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, trans portation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources, including, but not limited to, on federal lands. if an agency assesses that use of either federal eminent domain authorities or authorities afforded under the defense production act (public law 81–774, 50 u.s.c. 4501 et seq.) are necessary to achieve this objective, the agency shall submit recommenda tions for a course of action to the president, through the assistant to the president for national security affairs.

(19 how.) 393 (1857), which misinterpreted the constitution as permanently excluding people of african descent from eligibility for united states citizenship solely based on their race. but the fourteenth amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizen ship universally to everyone born within the united states. the fourteenth amendment has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the united states but not ‘‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’’ consistent with this understanding, the congress has further specified through legislation that ‘‘a person born in the united states, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof’’ is a national and citizen of the united states at birth, 8 u.s.c. 1401, generally mirroring the fourteenth amendment’s text. among the categories of individuals born in the united states and not subject to the jurisdiction thereof, the privilege of united states citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the united states: (1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the united states and the father was not a united states citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the united states at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited to, visiting the united states under the auspices of the visa waiver program or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a united states citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth. sec. 2. policy. (a) it is the policy of the united states that no department or agency of the united states government shall issue documents recognizing united states citizenship, or accept documents issued by state, local, or other governments or authorities purporting to recognize united states citi zenship, to persons: (1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the united states and the person’s father was not a united states citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the united states was lawful but temporary, and the person’s father was not a united states citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth.

14152,01/29/2025,Holding Former Government Officials Accountable for Election Interference and Improper Disclosure of Sensitive Governmental Information,"presidential documents executive order 14152 of january 20, 2025 holding former government officials accountable for elec tion interference and improper disclosure of sensitive gov ernmental information by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, it is hereby ordered: section 1. purpose. in the closing weeks of the 2020 presidential campaign, at least 51 former intelligence officials coordinated with the biden campaign to issue a letter discrediting the reporting that president joseph r. biden’s son had abandoned his laptop at a computer repair business. signatories of the letter falsely suggested that the news story was part of a russian disinformation campaign. before being issued, the letter was sent to the cia prepublication classifica tion review board, the body typically assigned to formally evaluate the sensitive nature of documents prior to publication. senior cia officials were made aware of the contents of the letter, and multiple signatories held clearances at the time and maintained ongoing contractual relationships with the cia. federal policymakers must be able to rely on analysis conducted by the intelligence community and be confident that it is accurate, crafted with professionalism, and free from politically motivated engineering to affect political outcomes in the united states. the signatories willfully weaponized the gravitas of the intelligence community to manipulate the political process and undermine our democratic institutions. this fabrication of the impri matur of the intelligence community to suppress information essential to the american people during a presidential election is an egregious breach of trust reminiscent of a third world country. and now the faith of americans in all other patriotic intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect the nation has been imperiled. national security is also damaged by the publication of classified information. former national security advisor john r. bolton published a memoir for monetary gain after he was terminated from his white house position in 2019. the book was rife with sensitive information drawn from his time in government. the memoir’s reckless treatment of sensitive information undermined the ability of future presidents to request and obtain candid advice on matters of national security from their staff. publication also created a grave risk that classified material was publicly exposed. to remedy these abuses of the public trust, this order directs the revocation of any active or current security clearances held by: (i) the former intelligence officials who engaged in misleading and inappropriate political coordination with the 2020 biden presidential campaign; and (ii) john r. bolton. sec. 2. policy.

(a) no federal department, agency, entity, officer, employee, or agent may act or use any federal re sources in a manner contrary to section 2 of this order. (b) the attorney general, in consultation with the heads of executive departments and agencies, shall investigate the activities of the federal government over the last 4 years that are inconsistent with the purposes and policies of this order and prepare a report to be submitted to the president, through the deputy chief of staff for policy, with recommendations for appropriate remedial actions to be taken based on the findings of the report. sec. 4. general provisions.
