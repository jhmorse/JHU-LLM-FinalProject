14321,3,107,endemic vagrancy disorderly behavior sud den confrontations and violent attacks have made our cities unsafe
14321,4,173,the number of individuals living on the streets in the united states on a single night during the last year of the previous administration274224was the highest ever recorded
14321,5,107,the overwhelming majority of these individuals are addicted to drugs have a mental health condition or both
14321,6,140,nearly twothirds of homeless individuals report having regularly used hard drugs like methamphetamines cocaine or opioids in their lifetimes
14321,7,95,an equally large share of homeless individuals reported suffering from mental health conditions
14321,8,204,the federal government and the states have spent tens of billions of dollars on failed programs that address homelessness but not its root causes leaving other citizens vulnerable to public safety threats
14321,9,161,shifting homeless individuals into longterm institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order
14321,10,117,surrendering our cities and citizens to disorder and fear is neither compassionate to the homeless nor other citizens

14322,1,32,saving college sports  section 1
14322,2,18,purpose and policy
14322,3,216,college sports are a uniquely american institution that provide lifechanging educational and leadershipdevelop ment opportunities to more than 500000 studentathletes through almost 4 billion in scholarships each year
14322,4,158,college athletics also provide substantial support to local economies and form an indelible part of family activities pastimes and culture in many communities
14322,5,238,while major college football games can draw tens of millions of television viewers and attendees they feature only a very small sample of the many athletes who benefit from the transformational opportunities that college athletics provide
14322,6,214,sixtyfive percent of the 2024 united states olympic team members were current or former national collegiate athletic association ncaa varsity athletes and approximately seventyfive percent were colle giate athletes
14322,7,139,the 2024 united states olympic team earned 126 total medals leading the overall medal count for the eighth consecutive summer olympic games
14322,8,182,beyond driving our unrivaled success in international competition college athletes are more likely to report better outcomes in important respects during college and after graduation
14322,9,257,a substantial majority of female execu tives at the largest american companies participated in sports during adoles cence many at the high school or collegiate level and examples of business leaders and former presidents who played college sports are legion
14322,10,150,it is no exaggeration to say that americas system of collegiate athletics plays an integral role in forging the leaders that drive our nations success
14322,11,62,yet the future of college sports is under unprecedented threat
14322,12,258,waves of recent litigation against collegiate athletics governing rules have eliminated limits on athlete compensation payforplay recruiting inducements and transfers between universities unleashing a sea change that threatens the viability of college sports
14322,13,220,while changes providing some increased benefits and flexibility to studentathletes were overdue and should be maintained the inability to maintain reasonable rules and guardrails is a mortal threat to most college sports
14322,14,243,to illustrate following a 2021 antitrust ruling from the united states su preme court striking down ncaa restrictions the ncaa changed its rules to permit players to receive compensation for their name image and likeness nil from third parties
14322,15,200,but guardrails designed to ensure that these were legitimate marketvalue nil payments for endorsements or similar services rather than simply payforplay inducements were eliminated through litiga tion
14322,16,86,other limits on player transfers among schools were also taken down through litigation
14322,17,164,this has created an outofcontrol rudderless system in which competing university donors engage in bidding wars for the best players who can change teams each season
14322,18,176,meanwhile more than 30 states have passed their own nil laws in a chaotic race to the bottom sometimes to gain temporary competitive advantages for their major collegiate teams
14322,19,137,as a result players at some universities will receive more than 50 million per year mostly for the revenuegenerating sports like football
14322,20,131,entering the 2024 season players on the eventual college football national champion team were being paid around 20 million annually
14322,21,119,by the 2025 season football players at one university will reportedly be paid 3540 million with revenuesharing included
14322,22,424,this not only reduces competition and parity by creating an oligarchy of teams that can simply buy the best playersincluding the best players from lesswealthy programs at the end of each seasonbut the imperative that university donors must devote everescalating resources to compete in the revenuegenerating sports like football and basketball siphons away the resources necessary to support the panoply of nonrevenue sports
14322,23,228,absent guardrails to stop the madness and ensure a reasonable balanced use of resources across collegiate athletic programs that preserves their educational and developmental benefits many college sports will soon cease to exist
14322,24,390,a national solution is urgently needed to prevent this situation from deterio rating beyond repair and to protect nonrevenue sports including many womens sports that comprise the backbone of intercollegiate athletics drive american superiority at the olympics and other international competitions and catalyze hundreds of thousands of studentathletes to fuel american success in myriad ways
14322,25,206,attempting to create some guardrails and shelter from litigation colleges have adopted a new regime deciding to pay athletes directly and simulta neously limit the total number of athletes on their campuses
14322,26,234,given that the new roster limits by exceeding the scholarship limits they replace will increase the potential number of scholarships available in many sports this opportunity must be utilized to strengthen and expand nonrevenue sports
14322,27,163,simultaneously the thirdparty market of payforplay inducements must be eliminated before its insatiable demand for resources dries up support for nonrevenue sports
14322,28,47,otherwise a crucial american asset will be lost
14322,29,109,it is the policy of my administration that all college sports should be preserved and where possible expanded
14322,30,219,my administration will therefore provide the stability fairness and balance necessary to protect student athletes collegiate athletic scholarships and opportunities and the special american institution of college sports
14322,31,135,it is common sense that college sports are not and should not be professional sports and my administration will take action accordingly
14322,32,100,protecting and expanding womens and nonrevenue sports and prohibiting thirdparty payforplay payments
14322,33,1310,a it is the policy of the executive branch that opportunities for scholarships and collegiate athletic competition in womens and nonrevenue sports must be preserved and where possible expanded including specifically as follows with respect to the 20252026 athletic season and future athletic seasons i collegiate athletic departments with greater than 125000000 in rev enue during the 20242025 athletic season should provide more scholar ship opportunities in nonrevenue sports than during the 20242025 ath letic season and should provide the maximum number of roster spots for nonrevenue sports permitted under the applicable collegiate athletic rules ii college athletic departments with greater than 50000000 in revenue during the 20242025 athletic season should provide at least as many scholarship opportunities in nonrevenue sports as provided during the 20242025 athletic season and should provide the maximum number of roster spots for nonrevenue sports permitted under the applicable colle giate athletic rules and iii college athletic departments with 50000000 or less in revenue during the 20242025 athletic season or that do not have any revenuegenerating sports should not disproportionately reduce scholarship opportunities or roster spots for sports based on the revenue that the sport generates
14322,34,279,b it is the policy of the executive branch that any revenuesharing per mitted between universities and collegiate athletes should be designed and implemented in a manner that preserves or expands scholarships and colle giate athletic opportunities in womens and nonrevenue sports
14322,35,261,c to preserve the critical educational and developmental benefits of collegiate athletics for our nation it is the policy of the executive branch that thirdparty payforplay payments to collegiate athletes are improper and should not be permitted by universities
14322,36,166,this policy does not apply to compensation provided to an athlete for the fair market value that the athlete provides to a third party such as for a brand endorsement
14322,37,722,d within 30 days of the date of this order the secretary of education in consultation with the attorney general the secretary of health and human services the secretary of education and the chairman of the federal trade commission shall develop a plan to advance the policies set forth in subsections ac of this section through all available and appropriate regulatory enforcement and litigation mechanisms including federal fund ing decisions enforcement of title ix of the education amendments act of 1972 prohibiting unconstitutional actions by states to regulate interstate commerce and enforcement of other constitutional and statutory protections and by working with the congress and state governments as appropriate

14322,40,53,legal protections for college athletics from lawsuits
14322,41,428,a the attorney general and the chairman of the federal trade commission shall work to stabilize and preserve college athletics through litigation guidelines poli cies or other actions as appropriate by protecting the rights and interests of studentathletes and the longterm availability of collegiate athletic scholar ships and opportunities when such elements are unreasonably challenged under antitrust or other legal theories
14322,42,377,b within 60 days of the date of this order to advance the purposes of subsection a of this section the attorney general and the chairman of the federal trade commission shall i review and as necessary revise litigation positions guidelines policies or other actions and ii develop a plan to implement appropriate future litigation positions guidelines policies or other actions

14319,1,55,preventing woke ai in the federal government  section 1
14319,2,7,purpose
14319,3,149,artificial intelligence ai will play a critical role in how americans of all ages learn new skills consume information and navigate their daily lives
14319,4,174,americans will require reliable outputs from ai but when ideological biases or social agendas are built into ai models they can distort the quality and accuracy of the output
14319,5,108,one of the most pervasive and destructive of these ideologies is socalled diversity equity and inclusion dei
14319,6,336,in the ai context dei includes the suppression or distortion of factual information about race or sex manipu lation of racial or sexual representation in model outputs incorporation of concepts like critical race theory transgenderism unconscious bias intersectionality and systemic racism and discrimination on the basis of race or sex
14319,7,145,dei displaces the commitment to truth in favor of preferred outcomes and as recent history illustrates poses an existential threat to reliable ai
14319,8,229,for example one major ai model changed the race or sex of historical figuresincluding the pope the founding fathers and vikingswhen prompted for images because it was trained to prioritize dei requirements at the cost of accuracy
14319,9,157,another ai model refused to produce images cele brating the achievements of white people even while complying with the same request for people of other races

14300,1,67,ordering the reform of the nuclear regulatory commission  section 1
14300,2,7,purpose
14300,3,66,abundant energy is a vital national and economic security interest
14300,4,126,in conjunction with domestic fossil fuel production nuclear energy can liberate america from dependence on geopolitical rivals
14300,5,161,it can power not only traditional manufacturing industries but also cuttingedge energyintensive industries such as artificial intelligence and quantum com puting
14300,6,134,between 1954 and 1978 the united states authorized the construction of 133 sincecompleted civilian nuclear reactors at 81 power plants
14300,7,161,since 1978 the nuclear regulatory commission nrc has authorized only a frac tion of that number of these only two reactors have entered into commercial operation
14300,8,158,the nrc charges applicants by the hour to process license applica tions with prolonged timelines that maximize fees while throttling nuclear power development
14300,9,160,the nrc has failed to license new reactors even as technological advances promise to make nuclear power safer cheaper more adaptable and more abundant than ever
14300,10,277,this failure stems from a fundamental error instead of efficiently promoting safe abundant nuclear energy the nrc has instead tried to insulate ameri cans from the most remote risks without appropriate regard for the severe domestic and geopolitical costs of such risk aversion
14300,11,155,the nrc utilizes safety models that posit there is no safe threshold of radiation exposure and that harm is directly proportional to the amount of exposure
14300,12,169,those models lack sound scientific basis and produce irrational results such as requiring that nuclear plants protect against radiation below naturally occur ring levels
14300,13,189,a myopic policy of minimizing even trivial risks ignores the reality that substitute forms of energy production also carry risk such as pollution with potentially deleterious health effects
14300,14,211,recent events in europe such as the nationwide blackouts in spain and portugal underscore the importance of my administrations focus on dispatchable power generationincluding nuclear powerover intermittent power
14300,15,120,beginning today my administration will reform the nrc including its structure personnel regulations and basic operations
14300,16,187,in so doing we will produce lasting american dominance in the global nuclear energy mar ket create tens of thousands of highpaying jobs and generate american led prosperity and resilience
14300,17,6,policy
14300,18,835,it is the policy of the united states to a reestablish the united states as the global leader in nuclear energy b facilitate increased deployment of new nuclear reactor technologies such as generation iii and iv reactors modular reactors and microreactors including by lowering regulatory and cost barriers to entry c facilitate the expansion of american nuclear energy capacity from approximately 100 gw in 2024 to 400 gw by 2050 d employ emerging technologies to safely accelerate the modeling simula tion testing and approval of new reactor designs e support the continued operation of and facilitate appropriate oper ational extensions for the current nuclear fleet as well as the reactivation of prematurely shuttered or partially completed nuclear facilities and f maintain the united states leading reputation for nuclear safety
14300,19,26,reforming the nrcs culture
14300,20,485,the congress has mandated that the nrcs licensing and regulation of the civilian use of radioactive materials and nuclear energy be conducted in a manner that is efficient and does not unnecessarily limit1 the civilian use of radioactive materials and deployment of nuclear energy or 2 the benefits of civilian use of radioactive materials and nuclear energy technology to society accelerating deploy ment of versatile advanced nuclear for clean energy act of 2024 public law 11867 sec
14300,21,4,501a
14300,22,117,just as the congress directed the nrcs mission shall include facilitating nuclear power while ensuring reactor safety

14301,6,164,the idaho national laboratory has principal responsi bility for constructing and testing new reactor designs it concluded construc tion of new reactors in the 1970s
14301,7,74,our proud history of innovation has succumbed to overregulated complacency
14301,8,332,as i stated in executive order 14156 of january 20 2025 declaring a national energy emergency the united states needs a reliable diversified and affordable supply of energy to drive development of advanced tech nologies manufacturing transportation agriculture and defense industries and to sustain modern life and national security
14301,9,78,nuclear energy both is vital to this effort and has never held so much promise
14301,10,279,decades of research and engineering have produced prototypes of advanced nuclear technologies that incorporate passive safety mechanisms improve the physical architecture of reactor designs increase reactor operational flexibility and performance and reduce risk in fuel disposal
14301,11,138,advanced reactorsincluding microreactors small modular reactors and generation iv and generation iii reactors have revolutionary potential
14301,12,180,they will open a range of new applications to support data centers microchip manufacturing petrochemical production healthcare desalination hydrogen production and other industries
14301,13,286,the united states cultivated the effort to design and build the first generation iv reactor for commercial use but the federal government has effectively throttled the domestic deployment of advanced reactors ceding the initiative to foreign nations in building this critical technology
14301,14,18,that changes today
14301,15,151,it is the policy of my administration to foster nuclear innovation and bring advanced nuclear technologies into domestic production as soon as possible

14303,2,18,policy and purpose
14303,3,113,over the last 5 years confidence that scientists act in the best interests of the public has fallen significantly
14303,4,126,a majority of researchers in science technology engineering and mathematics believe science is facing a reproducibility crisis
14303,5,112,the falsification of data by leading researchers has led to highprofile retractions of federally funded research
14303,6,74,unfortunately the federal government has contributed to this loss of trust
14303,7,143,in several notable cases executive departments and agencies agencies have used or promoted scientific information in a highly misleading manner
14303,8,249,for example under the prior administration the centers for disease control and prevention issued covid19 guidance on reopening schools that incor porated edits by the american federation of teachers and was understood to discourage inperson learning
14303,9,435,this guidances restrictive and burdensome reopening conditions led many schools to remain at least partially closed resulting in substantial negative effects on educational outcomeseven though the best available scientific evidence showed that children were unlikely to transmit or suffer serious illness or death from the virus and that opening schools with reasonable mitigation measures would have only minor effects on transmission
14303,10,207,the national marine fisheries service justified a biological opinion by adopt ing an admitted worstcase scenario projection of the north atlantic right whale population that it believed was very likely wrong
14303,11,84,the agencys proposed actions could have destroyed the historic maine lobster fishery
14303,12,6,the dc
14303,13,161,circuit court of appeals subsequently overturned that opinion because the agencys decision to seek out the worstcase scenario skewed its approach to the evidence
14303,14,160,similarly agencies have used representative concentration pathway rcp scenario 85 to assess the potential effects of climate change in a higher warming scenario
14303,15,143,rcp 85 is a worstcase scenario based on highly unlikely assumptions like endofcentury coal use exceeding estimates of recoverable coal reserves
14303,16,79,scientists have warned that presenting rcp 85 as a likely outcome is misleading
14303,17,232,actions taken by the prior administration further politicized science for example by encouraging agencies to incorporate diversity equity and inclu sion considerations into all aspects of science planning execution and communication
14303,18,211,scientific integrity in the production and use of science by the federal government is critical to maintaining the trust of the american people and ensuring confidence in government decisions informed by science
14303,19,264,my administration is committed to restoring a gold standard for science to ensure that federally funded research is transparent rigorous and impactful and that federal decisions are informed by the most credible reliable and impartial scientific evidence available
14303,20,161,we must restore the american peoples faith in the scientific enterprise and institutions that create and apply scientific knowledge in service of the public good
14303,21,66,repro ducibility rigor and unbiased peer review must be maintained
14303,22,336,this order restores the scientific integrity policies of my first administration and ensures that agencies practice data transparency acknowledge relevant scientific uncertainties are transparent about the assumptions and likelihood of sce narios used approach scientific findings objectively and communicate sci entific data accurately
14303,23,189,agency use of gold standard science as set forth in this order will spur innovation translate discovery to success and ensure continued american strength and global leadership in technology

14297,1,86,delivering mostfavorednation prescription drug pricing to american patients  section 1
14297,2,7,purpose
14297,3,139,the united states has less than five percent of the worlds population and yet funds around three quarters of global pharma ceutical profits
14297,4,234,this egregious imbalance is orchestrated through a purpose ful scheme in which drug manufacturers deeply discount their products to access foreign markets and subsidize that decrease through enormously high prices in the united states
14297,5,131,the united states has for too long turned its back on americans who unwittingly sponsor both drug manufacturers and other countries
14297,6,279,these entities today rely on price markups on american consumers generous public subsidies for research and development primarily through the national institutes of health and robust public financing of prescription drug con sumption through federal and state healthcare programs
14297,7,266,drug manufactur ers rather than seeking to equalize evident price discrimination agree to other countries demands for low prices and simultaneously fight against the ability for public and private payers in the united states to negotiate the best prices for patients
14297,8,108,the inflated prices in the united states fuel global innovation while foreign health systems get a free ride
14297,9,124,this abuse of americans generosity who deserve lowcost pharmaceuticals on the same terms as other developed nations must end
14297,10,133,americans will no longer be forced to pay almost three times more for the exact same medicines often made in the exact same factories
14297,11,78,as the largest purchaser of pharmaceuticals americans should get the best deal
14297,12,6,policy
14297,13,178,americans should not be forced to subsidize lowcost prescrip tion drugs and biologics in other developed countries and face overcharges for the same products in the united states
14297,14,86,americans must therefore have access to the mostfavorednation price for these products
14297,15,225,my administration will take immediate steps to end global freeloading and should drug manufacturers fail to offer american consumers the mostfa vorednation lowest price my administration will take additional aggressive action
14297,16,70,addressing foreign nations freeloading on americanfinanced inno vation
14297,17,532,the secretary of commerce and the united states trade representa tive shall take all necessary and appropriate action to ensure foreign countries are not engaged in any act policy or practice that may be unreasonable or discriminatory or that may impair united states national security and that has the effect of forcing american patients to pay for a disproportionate amount of global pharmaceutical research and development including by suppressing the price of pharmaceutical products below fair market value in foreign countries
14297,18,84,enabling directtoconsumer sales to american patients at the most favorednation price
14297,19,251,to the extent consistent with law the secretary of health and human services secretary shall facilitate directtoconsumer purchasing programs for pharmaceutical manufacturers that sell their prod ucts to american patients at the mostfavorednation price

14294,1,62,fighting overcriminalization in federal regulations  section 1
14294,2,7,purpose
14294,3,46,the united states is drastically overregulated
14294,4,160,the code of federal regulations contains over 48000 sections stretching over 175000 pagesfar more than any citizen can possibly read let alone fully under stand
14294,5,60,worse many carry potential criminal penalties for violations
14294,6,300,the situation has become so dire that no onelikely including those charged with enforcing our criminal laws at the department of justiceknows how many separate criminal offenses are contained in the code of federal regula tions with at least one source estimating hundreds of thousands of such crimes
14294,7,147,many of these regulatory crimes are strict liability offenses mean ing that citizens need not have a guilty mental state to be convicted of a crime
14294,8,36,this status quo is absurd and unjust
14294,9,75,it allows the executive branch to write the law in addition to executing it
14294,10,129,that situation can lend itself to abuse and weaponization by providing government officials tools to target unwitting individuals
14294,11,175,it privileges large corporations which can afford to hire expensive legal teams to navigate complex regulatory schemes and fence out new market entrants over average americans
14294,12,197,the purpose of this order is to ease the regulatory burden on everyday americans and ensure no american is transformed into a criminal for vio lating a regulation they have no reason to know exists
14294,13,6,policy
14294,14,111,it is the policy of the united states that a criminal enforcement of criminal regulatory offenses is disfavored
14294,15,248,b prosecution of criminal regulatory offenses is most appropriate for persons who know or can be presumed to know what is prohibited or required by the regulation and willingly choose not to comply thereby causing or risking substantial public harm
14294,16,146,prosecutions of criminal regu latory offenses should focus on matters where a putative defendant is alleged to have known his conduct was unlawful

14294,25,344,for purposes of this order a agency has the meaning given to executive agency in section 105 of title 5 united states code b criminal regulatory offense means a federal regulation that is enforce able by a criminal penalty and c mens rea means the state of mind that by law must be proven to convict a particular defendant of a particular crime

14293,5,77,unfortunately the prior ad ministration did too little to advance these goals
14293,6,149,critical barriers and infor mation gaps persist in establishing a domestic resilient and affordable pharmaceutical supply chain for american patients
14293,7,130,one key area of concern is the length of time it takes to build pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in the united states today
14293,8,257,new construction must navigate myriad federal state and local requirements ranging from building standards and zoning restrictions to environmental protocols that together diminish the certainty needed to generate investment for large manufacturing projects
14293,9,229,for pharmaceutical manufacturing these barriers are heightened by unannounced inspections of domestic manufacturers by the food and drug administration fda which are more frequent than such inspections at international facilities
14293,10,200,industry estimates suggest that building new manu facturing capacity for pharmaceuticals and critical inputs may take as long as 5 to 10 years which is unacceptable from a national security standpoint
14293,11,285,even expanding existing capacity or modifying existing production lines to produce new or different products requires extensive permitting and regulatory approval making it more difficult to repurpose existing underuti lized pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity available domestically
14293,12,132,it is in the best interest of the nation to eliminate regulatory barriers to the domestic production of the medicines americans need

14290,4,129,unlike in 1967 when the cpb was established today the media landscape is filled with abundant diverse and innovative news options
14290,5,150,government funding of news media in this environment is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence
14290,6,179,at the very least americans have the right to expect that if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting at all they fund only fair accurate unbi ased and nonpartisan news coverage
14290,7,152,no media outlet has a constitutional right to taxpayer subsidies and the government is entitled to determine which categories of activities to subsidize
14290,8,141,the cpbs governing statute re flects principles of impartiality the cpb may not contribute to or otherwise support any political party 47 usc
14290,9,17,396f3 see also id
14290,10,5,396e2
14290,11,82,the cpb fails to abide by these principles to the extent it subsidizes npr and pbs
14290,12,52,which viewpoints npr and pbs promote does not matter
14290,13,126,what does matter is that neither entity presents a fair accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens
14290,14,150,i therefore instruct the cpb board of directors cpb board and all executive departments and agencies agencies to cease federal funding for npr and pbs
14290,15,55,instructions to the corporation for public broadcasting

14290,18,237,b the cpb board shall cease indirect funding to npr and pbs including by ensuring that licensees and permittees of public radio and television stations as well as any other recipients of cpb funds do not use federal funds for npr and pbs
14290,19,306,to effectuate this directive the cpb board shall before june 30 2025 revise the 2025 television community service grants general provisions and eligibility criteria and the 2025 radio community service grants general provisions and eligibility criteria to prohibit direct or indirect funding of npr and pbs

14291,1,60,establishment of the religious liberty commission  section 1
14291,2,18,purpose and policy
14291,3,151,it shall be the policy of the executive branch to vigorously enforce the historic and robust protections for religious liberty enshrined in federal law
14291,4,274,the founders envisioned a nation in which religious voices and views are integral to a vibrant public square and human flourishing and in which religious people and institutions are free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or hostility from the government
14291,5,231,indeed the roots of religious liberty stretch back to the early settlers who fled religious persecution in europe seeking a new world where they could choose follow and practice their faith without interference from the govern ment
14291,6,117,the principle of religious liberty was enshrined in american law with the first amendment to the constitution in 1791
14291,7,116,since that time the constitution has protected the fundamental right to religious liberty as americans first freedom
14291,8,110,during my first term i issued executive order 13798 of may 4 2017 pro moting free speech and religious liberty
14291,9,188,pursuant to that order the attor ney general issued a memorandum for all executive departments and agen cies agencies titled federal law protections for religious liberty on october 6 2017
14291,10,218,the supreme court has also continued to vindicate the founders commitment to religious liberty including by giving effect to the principle that religious voices should be welcomed on an equal basis in the public square
14291,11,130,in recent years some federal state and local policies have threatened americas unique and beautiful tradition of religious liberty
14291,12,313,these policies attempt to infringe upon longstanding conscience protections prevent parents from sending their children to religious schools threaten loss of funding or denial of nonprofit tax status for faithbased entities and single out religious groups and institutions for exclusion from governmental programs
14291,13,83,some opponents of religious liberty would remove religion entirely from public life
14291,14,245,others characterize religious liberty as inconsistent with civil rights despite religions vital roles in the abolition of slavery the passage of federal civil rights laws and the provision of indispensable social edu cational and health services
14291,15,242,president ronald reagan reminded us that freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction americans need to be reacquainted with our nations superb experiment in religious freedom in order to preserve it against emerging threats
14291,16,270,therefore the federal government will promote citizens pride in our foundational history identify emerging threats to reli gious liberty uphold federal laws that protect all citizens full participation in a pluralistic democracy and protect the free exercise of religion

14286,1,77,enforcing commonsense rules of the road for americas truck drivers  section 1
14286,2,7,purpose
14286,3,137,americas truck drivers are essential to the strength of our economy the security of our nation and the livelihoods of the american people
14286,4,166,every day truckers perform the demanding and dangerous work of transporting the nations goods to businesses customers and com munities safely reliably and efficiently
14286,5,252,proficiency in english which i designated as our official national language in executive order 14224 of march 1 2025 designating english as the official language of the united states should be a nonnegotiable safety requirement for professional drivers
14286,6,167,they should be able to read and under stand traffic signs communicate with traffic safety border patrol agricultural checkpoints and cargo weightlimit station officers
14286,7,107,drivers need to provide feedback to their employers and customers and receive related directions in english
14286,8,20,this is common sense
14286,9,412,that is why federal law requires that to operate a commercial vehicle a driver must read and speak the english language sufficiently to converse with the general public to understand highway traffic signs and signals in the english language to respond to official inquiries and to make entries on reports and records yet this requirement has not been enforced in years and americas roadways have become less safe

14287,1,63,protecting american communities from criminal aliens  section 1
14287,2,18,purpose and policy
14287,3,96,federal supremacy with respect to immigra tion national security and foreign policy is axiomatic
14287,4,249,the constitution provides the federal government with plenary authority regarding immigra tion to protect the sovereignty of our nation and to conduct relations with other nations who must be able to deal with one national government on such matters
14287,5,390,this power is sometimes contained in specific constitutional provisions article ii of the constitution vests the power to protect national security and conduct foreign policy in of the united states and article iv section 4 requires the federal government to protect each of the states against invasion this federal power over immigration is also an inherent element of national sovereignty
14287,6,98,the prior administration allowed unchecked millions of aliens to illegally enter the united states
14287,7,321,the resulting public safety and national security risks are exacerbated by the presence of and control of territory by inter national cartels and other transnational criminal organizations along the southern border as well as terrorists and other malign actors who intend to harm the united states and the american people
14287,8,125,this invasion at the southern border requires the federal government to take measures to fulfill its obligation to the states
14287,9,152,yet some state and local officials nevertheless continue to use their authority to violate obstruct and defy the enforcement of federal immigration laws
14287,10,165,this is a lawless insurrection against the supremacy of federal law and the federal governments obligation to defend the territorial sovereignty of the united states
14287,11,168,beyond the intolerable national security risks such nullification efforts often violate federal criminal laws including those pro hibiting obstruction of justice 18 usc

14287,13,48,1324 conspiracy against the united states 18 usc

14287,15,3,372
14287,16,134,assisting aliens in violating federal immigration law could also violate the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 18 usc
14287,17,11,1961 et seq
14287,18,186,some measures to assist illegal aliens also necessarily violate federal laws prohibiting discrimination against americans in favor of illegal aliens and protecting americans civil rights
14287,19,89,it is imperative that the federal government restore the enforcement of united states law
14287,20,38,designation of sanctuary jurisdictions

14284,1,131,strengthening probationary periods in the federal service  including sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5 united states code section 1
14284,2,7,purpose
14284,3,139,the american people deserve a federal workforce that is highquality efficient dedicated to the public interest and no larger than necessary
14284,4,272,probationary periods for employees in the competitive serv ice and trial periods for employees in the excepted service have provided a longstanding critical tool to assess the fitness of newly hired federal employees before finalizing their appointments to federal service
14284,5,232,the government accountability office has documented however that agen cies have not been using probationary and trial periods as effectively as they could to remove appointees whose continued employment is not in the public interest
14284,6,195,as a result of this failure to remove poor performers agencies have often retained and given tenure to underperforming employees who should have been screened out during their probationary period
14284,7,144,conditions of good administration require that agency approval should be required before probationary employees become tenured federal employees
14284,8,498,as the merit systems protection board recommended in its 2005 report the probationary period a critical assessment opportunity there should be procedures so that a probationer does not automatically become an employee in the absence of agency action and in the absence of agency certification that the probationer will be an asset to the government the probationers employment should automatically terminate upon the expira tion of the probationary period this order directs this commonsense change
14284,9,328,further the regulations at subpart h of part 315 of title 5 code of federal regulations which purport to limit agency action with respect to employees serving a probationary period are not statutorily required place undue burdens on agencies in terminating probationary employees and deter man agers from undertaking that effort
14284,10,149,to ensure that agencies make better use of probationary and trial periods this order issues a new civil service rule xi that will supersede subpart h
14284,11,229,under civil service rule xi agencies will have to affirmatively determine that the continued employment of individuals serving probationary or trial periods would benefit the federal service before such appointments are finalized
14284,12,31,repeal of civil service rule 24
14284,13,104,civil service rule ii is amended by removing section 24 of part 2 of title 5 code of federal regulations

14284,17,77,it has no application to probationary periods in the senior executive service
14284,18,295, 112 probationary period when required a the first year of service of an employee who is given a career or careerconditional appointment in the competitive service under the civil service regulations is a probationary period when the employee 1 was appointed from a competitive list of eligibles
14284,19,454,2 was reinstated including reinstatement from a reinstatement priority list unless during any period of service that affords a current basis for reinstatement the employee completed a probationary period of at least 1 year or served with competitive status under an appointment that did not require a probationary period provided that the date of reinstatement begins a new 12month probationary period if one is required under paragraph a of this section
14284,20,290,b a person who is required to go through a probationary period and then is transferred promoted demoted or reassigned in accordance with the civil service regulations before he or she completes such period is required to complete the remainder of the probationary period in the new position

14284,26,318, 113 trial period when required a the first year of continuous service in the same or similar position of a preference eligible in the excepted service or the first 2 years of continuous service in the same or similar position of an individual in the excepted service other than a preference eligible is a trial period
14284,27,227,b a person who is required to go through a trial period and is transferred promoted demoted or reassigned before he or she completes the trial period is required to complete the remainder of the trial period in the new position
14284,28,361,c an individual who separates from the federal service for a period of more than 30 days after completing a trial period and who subsequently is reappointed to an excepted service position must complete a new trial period unless such individual is appointed to the same or a substantially similar position in the same agency as their most recently held position
14284,29,446, 114 crediting service a prior federal civilian service including nonappropriated fund service counts toward completion of a probationary or trial period as applicable when the prior service 1 is in the same agency eg department of the army 2 is in the same line of work as determined by the employees actual duties and responsibilities and 3 contains or is followed by no more than a single break in service that does not exceed 30 calendar days
14284,30,100,b periods of absence while in a pay status count toward completion of a probationary or trial period
14284,31,137,absence in nonpay status while on the rolls other than for compensable injury or military duty is creditable up to a total of 22 workdays
14284,32,136,absence whether on or off the rolls due to compensable injury or military duty is creditable in full upon restoration to federal service
14284,33,103,nonpay time in excess of 22 workdays extends the probationary period or trial period by an equal amount
14284,34,144,c the probationary or trial period for parttime employees is computed on the basis of calendar time in the same manner as for fulltime employees
14284,35,273,for intermittent employees ie those who do not have regularly scheduled tours of duty each day or part of a day in pay status counts as one day of credit toward the 260 days or 520 days as applicable in a pay status required for completion of a probationary or trial period
14284,36,111,under no circumstances shall the probationary or trial period be completed in less than 1 year of calendar time

14284,39,207,b a probationary or trial period ends when the employee completes his or her scheduled tour of duty on the day before the anniversary date or as applicable 2year anniversary date of the employees appointment
14284,40,291,for example when the last workday is a friday and the anniversary date is the following monday a probationer will be separated before the end of the tour of duty on friday if their agency does not make the requisite certification that their continued appointment advances the public interest
14284,41,213,c an employee on a probationary or trial period bears the burden of demonstrating why their continuation in employment through the finalization of their appointment to the federal service is in the public interest
14284,42,535,d in determining whether it is in the public interest to finalize the appointment to the federal service of an employee in a probationary or trial period the agency head or his or her designee may consider in his or her sole and exclusive discretion 1 the employees performance and conduct 2 the needs and interests of the agency 3 whether the employees continued employment would advance organi zational goals of the agency or the government and 4 whether the employees continued employment would advance the efficiency of the service
14284,43,175,e before an agency terminates the service of an employee serving a probationary or trial period it shall notify such employee in writing as to the effective date of the action

14279,1,65,reforming accreditation to strengthen higher education  section 1
14279,2,7,purpose
14279,3,219,a group of higher education accreditors are the gate keepers that decide which colleges and universities american students can spend the more than 100 billion in federal student loans and pell grants dispersed each year
14279,4,115,the accreditors job is to determine which institutions provide a quality educationand therefore merit accreditation
14279,5,165,unfortu nately accreditors have not only failed in this responsibility to students families and american taxpayers but they have also abused their enormous authority
14279,6,93,accreditors routinely approve institutions that are lowquality by the most important measures
14279,7,85,the national sixyear undergraduate graduation rate was an alarming 64 percent in 2020
14279,8,347,further many accredited institutions offer undergraduate and graduate programs with a negative return on invest mentalmost 25 percent of bachelors degrees and more than 40 percent of masters degreeswhich may leave students financially worse off and in enormous debt by charging them exorbitant sums for a degree with very modest earnings potential
14279,9,319,notwithstanding this slide in graduation rates and graduates performance in the labor market the spike in debt obligations in relation to expected earnings and repayment rates on student loans accreditors have remained improperly focused on compelling adoption of discriminatory ideology rather than on student outcomes
14279,10,367,some accreditors make the adoption of unlawfully discriminatory practices a formal standard of accreditation and therefore a condition of accessing federal aid through diversity equity and inclu sion or deibased standards of accreditation that require institutions to share results on diversity equity and inclusion dei in the context of their mission by considering 
14279,11,13,demographics 
14279,12,120,and resource alloca tion accreditors have also abused their governance standards to intrude on state and local authority
14279,13,579,the american bar associations council of the section of legal education and admissions to the bar council which is the sole federally recognized accreditor for juris doctor programs has required law schools to dem onstrate by concrete action a commitment to diversity and inclusion includ ing by committing to having a student body and faculty that is diverse with respect to gender race and ethnicity as the attorney general has concluded and informed the council the discriminatory requirement bla tantly violates the supreme courts decision in students for fair admissions inc
14279,14,47,president and fellows of harvard college 600 us
14279,15,8,181 2023
14279,16,171,though the council subsequently suspended its enforcement while it con siders proposed revisions this standard and similar unlawful mandates must be permanently eradicated
14279,17,846,the liaison committee on medical education which is the only federally recognized body that accredits doctor of medicine degree programs requires that an institution engage  in ongoing systematic and focused recruitment and retention activities to achieve missionappropriate diversity outcomes among its students the accreditation council for graduate medical edu cation which is the sole accreditor for both allopathic and osteopathic medical residency and fellowship programs similarly expects institutions to focus on implementing policies and procedures related to recruitment and retention of individuals underrepresented in medicine including racial and ethnic minority individuals the standards for training tomorrows doctors should focus solely on providing the highest quality care and cer tainly not on requiring unlawful discrimination
14279,18,226,american students and taxpayers deserve better and my administration will reform our dysfunctional accreditation system so that colleges and universities focus on delivering highquality academic programs at a reason able price
14279,19,119,federal recognition will not be provided to accreditors engaging in unlawful discrimination in violation of federal law
14279,20,52,holding accreditors accountable for unlawful actions
14279,21,482,a the sec retary of education shall as appropriate and consistent with applicable law hold accountable including through denial monitoring suspension or termination of accreditation recognition accreditors who fail to meet the applicable recognition criteria or otherwise violate federal law including by requiring institutions seeking accreditation to engage in unlawful discrimi nation in accreditationrelated activity under the guise of diversity equity and inclusion initiatives
14279,22,350,b the attorney general and the secretary of education shall as appro priate and consistent with applicable law investigate and take appropriate action to terminate unlawful discrimination by american law schools that is advanced by the council including unlawful diversity equity and inclu sion requirements under the guise of accreditation standards
14279,23,139,the secretary of education shall also assess whether to suspend or terminate the councils status as an accrediting agency under federal law
14279,24,548,c the attorney general and the secretary of education in consultation with the secretary of health and human services shall investigate and take appropriate action to terminate unlawful discrimination by american medical schools or graduate medical education entities that is advanced by the liaison committee on medical education or the accreditation council for graduate medical education or other accreditors of graduate medical education including unlawful diversity equity and inclusion require ments under the guise of accreditation standards
14279,25,354,the secretary of education shall also assess whether to suspend or terminate the committees or the accreditation councils status as an accrediting agency under federal law or take other appropriate action to ensure lawful conduct by medical schools graduate medical education programs and other entities that receive federal funding for medical education

14279,28,657,b to advance the policies and objectives in subsection a of this section the secretary of education shall i resume recognizing new accreditors to increase competition and ac countability in promoting highquality highvalue academic programs fo cused on student outcomes ii mandate that accreditors require member institutions to use data on programlevel student outcomes to improve such outcomes without ref erence to race ethnicity or sex iii promptly provide to accreditors any noncompliance findings relating to member institutions issued after an investigation conducted by the office of civil rights under title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 42 usc

14280,1,115,reinstating commonsense school discipline policies  and to ensure safety and order in american classrooms section 1
14280,2,18,purpose and policy
14280,3,216,the federal government will no longer tolerate known risks to childrens safety and wellbeing in the classroom that result from the application of school discipline based on discriminatory and unlawful equity ideology
14280,4,140,in january 2014 the department of education and the department of justice jointly issued a dear colleague letter regarding school discipline
14280,5,496,in that letter the department of education and the department of justice explained that schools could be found to violate title vi of the civil rights act of 1964and therefore could lose federal fundingif their disciplinary decisions ran afoul of a newly imposed disparateimpact framework under which raceneutral disciplinary policies applied in an evenhanded manner may be improper if members of any racial groups are suspended expelled or referred to law enforcement at higher rates than others
14280,6,172,the letter effec tively required schools to discriminate on the basis of race by imposing discipline based on racial characteristics rather than on objective behavior alone
14280,7,44,the consequences harmed students and schools
14280,8,454,a 2018 report from the federal commission on school safety commission noted evidence that because of the 2014 letter schools ignored or covered uprather than disciplinedstudent misconduct in order to avoid any purported racial dis parity in discipline numbers that might catch the eye of the federal govern ment as a result students who should have been suspended or expelled for dangerous behavior remained in the classroom making all students less safe
14280,9,562,as the commission found when school leaders focus on aggregate school discipline numbers rather than the specific circumstances and conduct that underlie each matter schools become less safe and research clearly indicates that the failure of schools to appropriately discipline disruptive students has consequences for overall student achievement the commis sions seemingly obvious conclusion was that disciplinary decisions are best left in the hands of classroom teachers and administrators and should be based on student behavior rather than racial statistics
14280,10,97,following the commissions report on december 18 2018 the 2014 dear colleague letter was rescinded
14280,11,331,in 2023 however the previous administra tions department of education and department of justice issued new guid ance noting that statistical racial disparities in student discipline may indicate violations of law and encouraging schools to collect analyze and adjust their disciplinary policies in light of racial disciplinary data
14280,12,166,the 2023 guidance thus effectively reinstated the practice of weaponizing title vi to promote an approach to school discipline based on discriminatory equity ideology
14280,13,129,as a consequence of these policies teachers and students are suffering increased levels of classroom disorder and school violence
14280,14,11,definitions
14280,15,147,as used herein a the definitions in the executive order of january 29 2025 ending radical indoctrination in k12 schooling shall apply to this order

14281,1,60,restoring equality of opportunity and meritocracy  section 1
14281,2,7,purpose
14281,3,95,a bedrock principle of the united states is that all citizens are treated equally under the law
14281,4,68,this principle guarantees equality of opportunity not equal outcomes
14281,5,95,it promises that people are treated as individuals not components of a particular race or group
14281,6,82,it encourages meritocracy and a colorblind society not race or sexbased favoritism
14281,7,123,adher ence to this principle is essential to creating opportunity encouraging achievement and sustaining the american dream
14281,8,266,but a pernicious movement endangers this foundational principle seeking to transform americas promise of equal opportunity into a divisive pursuit of results preordained by irrelevant immutable characteristics regardless of individual strengths effort or achievement
14281,9,411,a key tool of this movement is disparateimpact liability which holds that a near insurmountable pre sumption of unlawful discrimination exists where there are any differences in outcomes in certain circumstances among different races sexes or similar groups even if there is no facially discriminatory policy or practice or discriminatory intent involved and even if everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed
14281,10,165,disparateimpact liability all but requires individuals and busi nesses to consider race and engage in racial balancing to avoid potentially crippling legal liability
14281,11,139,it not only undermines our national values but also runs contrary to equal protection under the law and therefore violates our constitution
14281,12,299,on a practical level disparateimpact liability has hindered businesses from making hiring and other employment decisions based on merit and skill their needs or the needs of their customers because of the specter that such a process might lead to disparate outcomes and thus disparateimpact lawsuits
14281,13,279,this has made it difficult and in some cases impossible for employers to use bona fide joboriented evaluations when recruiting which prevents job seekers from being paired with jobs to which their skills are most suitedin other words it deprives them of opportunities for success
14281,14,138,because of disparateimpact liability employers cannot act in the best inter ests of the job applicant the employer and the american public
14281,15,125,disparateimpact liability imperils the effectiveness of civil rights laws by mandating rather than proscribing discrimination
14281,16,311,as the supreme court put it the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race disparateimpact liability is wholly inconsistent with the constitution and threatens the commitment to merit and equality of opportunity that forms the foundation of the american dream
14281,17,163,under my administration citizens will be treated equally before the law and as individuals not consigned to a certain fate based on their immutable characteristics
14281,18,6,policy
14281,19,222,it is the policy of the united states to eliminate the use of disparateimpact liability in all contexts to the maximum degree possible to avoid violating the constitution federal civil rights laws and basic american ideals

14272,11,170,they are key building blocks of our manufacturing base and foundational to sectors ranging from transportation and energy to telecommunications and advanced manufacturing
14272,12,78,these economic sectors are moreover foundational to americas national security
14272,13,218,processed critical minerals and their derivative products are essential for national security because they are foundational to military infrastructure energy infrastructure and advanced defense systems and technologies
14272,14,219,they are key building blocks of our defense industrial base and integral to applica tions such as jet engines missile guidance systems advanced computing radar systems advanced optics and secure communications equipment
14272,15,137,the united states manufacturing and defense industrial bases remain de pendent on foreign sources for processed critical mineral products
14272,16,95,many of these foreign sources are at risk of serious sustained and longterm supply chain shocks
14272,17,237,should the united states lose access to processed critical minerals from foreign sources the united states commercial and defense manufacturing base for derivative products could face significant shortages and an inability to meet demand
14272,18,48,associated risks arise from a variety of factors
14272,19,130,first global supply chains are prone to disruption from geopolitical tensions wars natural disasters pandemics and trade conflicts
14272,20,481,second major global foreign producers of processed critical minerals have engaged in widespread price manipulation overcapacity arbitrary export restrictions and the exploitation of their supply chain dominance to distort world markets and thereby gain geopolitical and economic leverage over the united states and other competitors that depend on processed critical minerals to manufacture derivative products essential to their economic and national security and national defense
14272,21,200,therefore the import dependence of the united states on processed critical minerals from foreign sources may pose a serious national security risk to the united states economy and defense preparedness
14272,22,203,third the risks arising from americas import dependence on processed critical minerals also extend to derivative products that are integral to the united states economy and economic and national security
14272,23,163,for the united states to manufacture derivative products it must have ready access to an affordable resilient and sustainable supply of processed critical minerals
14272,24,159,simultaneously a resilient and sustainable manufacturing base for derivative products is vital to creating a stable demand base for processed critical minerals
14272,25,69,both must coexist to ensure economic stability and national secu rity
14272,26,139,finally overreliance on a small number of geographic regions amplifies the risks posed by geopolitical instability and regional disruptions
14272,27,239,in light of the above risks and realities an investigation under section 232 of the act section 232 is necessary to determine whether imports of processed critical minerals and their derivative products threaten to impair national security
14272,28,11,definitions
14272,29,223,as used in this order a the term critical minerals means those minerals included in the critical minerals list published by the united states geological survey usgs pursuant to section 7002c of the energy act of 2020 30 usc

14272,33,234,c the term processed critical minerals refers to critical minerals that have undergone the activities that occur after critical mineral ore is extracted from a mine up through its conversion into a metal metal powder or a master alloy
14272,34,192,these activities specifically occur beginning from the point at which ores are converted into oxide concentrates separated into oxides and converted into metals metal powders and master alloys
14272,35,104,d the term derivative products includes all goods that incorporate processed critical minerals as inputs
14272,36,281,these goods include semifinished goods such as semiconductor wafers anodes and cathodes as well as final products such as permanent magnets motors electric vehicles bat teries smartphones microprocessors radar systems wind turbines and their components and advanced optical devices

14273,1,69,lowering drug prices by once again putting americans first  section 1
14273,2,7,purpose
14273,3,170,my first term included numerous significant actions including some of the most aggressive in recent history to deliver lower prescription drug prices to american patients
14273,4,243,the message was clear no longer would the executive branch sit idly by as pharmaceutical manufactur ers charged patients in our nation more than those in other countries for the exact same prescription drugs often made in the exact same places
14273,5,225,these actions included encouraging the development of generic and bio similar alternatives to higher cost brand name prescription drugs and bio logics to harness competitive forces and increase access to affordable medi cines
14273,6,137,the united states also for the first time established a pathway to expand access to lower cost drugs imported from outside of the country
14273,7,127,reform efforts ensured that governmentmandated discounts were passed through to patients instead of being retained by middlemen
14273,8,147,new price transparency rules were promulgated to allow patients doctors and employ ers to see the actual cost of prescription drugs before purchase
14273,9,181,insulin copayments were capped for medicare beneficiaries and manufacturers in stead of patients and taxpayers were forced to foot the bill through the provision of larger discounts
14273,10,155,i also called on the congress to come to the table to help craft sustainable solutions that would promote innovation and affordable access for the longterm
14273,11,193,when the congress refused i pro posed the test of an innovative new payment mechanism that would prevent drug manufacturers from charging our patients much higher prices than those found abroad
14273,12,200,combined these bold actions were delivering real savings for american patients and set the foundation to dramatically narrow the price disparity between the united states and foreign nations over time
14273,13,147,unsurprisingly the biden administration reversed walked back or neglected many of these initiatives undoing the progress made for american patients
14273,14,148,the biden administration then signed into law the misnamed inflation reduction act which included the medicare prescription drug negotiation program
14273,15,213,while this program has the commendable goal of reducing the drug prices medicare and its beneficiaries pay its administratively complex and expensive regime has thus far produced much lower savings than pro jected
14273,16,208,further accompanying changes to the medicare part d program led to inflated premiums and diminished coverage choices for seniors prompting a taxpayerfunded bailout of insurance companies offering part d plans
14273,17,172,finally the program imposes price controls on small molecule prescription drugs usually in tablet or capsule form 4 years earlier than on large molecule biological products
14273,18,297,known as the pill penalty this discrepancy threatens to distort innovation by pushing investment towards expensive biological products which are often indicated to treat rarer diseases and away from small molecule prescription drugs which are generally cheaper and treat larger patient populations
14273,19,34,the american people deserve better
14273,20,169,it is time to restore the progress our nation made in my first term to deliver lower prescription drug prices by putting americans first and making america healthy again
14273,21,6,policy
14273,22,232,it is the policy of the united states that federal health care programs intellectual property protections and safety regulations are optimized to provide access to prescription drugs at lower costs to american patients and taxpayers

14274,4,153,to provide the highest quality services in an efficient and costeffective manner executive departments and agencies agencies must be where the people are
14274,5,207,president carter signed executive order 12072 of august 16 1978 federal space management ordering the federal government to prioritize central business districts when siting federal facilities in urban areas
14274,6,130,intended to improve these districts president carters order has instead prevented agencies from relocating to lowercost facilities
14274,7,313,building on executive order 12072 president clinton signed executive order 13006 of may 21 1996 locating federal facilities on historic properties in our nations central cities to encourage agencies to locate their facilities in historic properties and districts especially when located in central busi ness areas
14274,8,133,much like president carters order president clintons order failed to adequately prioritize efficient and effective government service

14275,1,56,restoring common sense to federal procurement  section 1
14275,2,7,purpose
14275,3,176,the federal government is the largest buyer of goods and services in the worldyet conducting business with the federal govern ment is often prohibitively inefficient and costly
14275,4,178,more than 40 years ago the federal acquisition regulation far was implemented to establish uniform procedures for acquisitions across executive departments and agen cies agencies
14275,5,429,the vision of the federal acquisition system codified at section 1102 of the far is to deliver on a timely basis the best value product or service to the customer while maintaining the publics trust and fulfilling public policy objectives but since its inception the far has swelled to more than 2000 pages of regulations evolving into an excessive and overcomplicated regulatory framework and resulting in an onerous bureaucracy
14275,6,102,federal procurement under the far receives consistently negative assess ments regarding its efficiency
14275,7,456,comprehensive studies such as the 2024 senate committee report entitled restoring freedoms forge and the 2019 report by the advisory panel on streamlining and codifying acquisition regulations created by the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2016 public law 11492 and made up of experts in acquisition and procurement policy conclude that the far is a barrier to rather than a prudent vehicle for doing business with the federal government
14275,8,164,its harmful effects permeate various items paid for by american taxpayers from commercial products like laptops and office supplies to major defense weapons systems
14275,9,111,the management and expenditure of nearly 1 trillion annually in procurements cannot continue on this trajectory
14275,10,109,fortunately its inadequacies are selfinflicted and can be remedied through a comprehen sive reform of the far
14275,11,286,executive order 14192 of january 31 2025 unleashing prosperity through deregulation established that the policy of the executive branch is to be prudent and financially responsible in the expenditure of funds and to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the american people
14275,12,45,reforming the far will advance this objective
14275,13,6,policy
14275,14,114,it is the policy of the united states to create the most agile effective and efficient procurement system possible
14275,15,161,removing undue barriers such as unnecessary regulations while simultaneously allowing for the expansion of the national and defense industrial bases is paramount
14275,16,182,accordingly the far should contain only provisions required by statute or essential to sound procurement and any far provisions that do not advance these objectives should be removed
14275,17,11,definitions

14263,2,10,background
14263,3,214,lawyers and law firms that engage in activities detrimental to critical american interests should not have access to our nations secrets nor should their conduct be subsidized by federal taxpayer funds or contracts
14263,4,331,my administration must also take appropriate and nec essary measures to guard against the actual potential or perceived conflicts of interest that arise when the government funds engages with or otherwise devotes resources to law firms and their clients that engage in conduct undermining critical american interests and priorities
14263,5,161,i have determined that action is necessary to address the significant risks egregious conduct and conflicts of interest associated with susman godfrey llp susman
14263,6,110,susman spearheads efforts to weaponize the american legal system and degrade the quality of american elections
14263,7,235,susman also funds groups that engage in dangerous efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the united states military through the injection of political and radical ideology and it supports efforts to discriminate on the basis of race
14263,8,94,susman itself engages in unlawful discrimination including discrimination on the basis of race
14263,9,456,for example susman administers a program where it offers financial awards and employment opportunities only to students of color my administration is committed to ending such unlawful discrimi nation perpetrated in the name of diversity equity and inclusion policies and ensuring that federal benefits support the laws and policies of the united states including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process
14263,10,218,those who engage in blatant discrimination and other activities inconsistent with the interests of the united states should not have access to our nations secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any federal funds

14260,1,58,protecting american energy from state overreach  section 1
14260,2,7,purpose
14260,3,334,my administration is committed to unleashing american energy especially through the removal of all illegitimate impediments to the identification development siting production investment in or use of domestic energy resourcesparticularly oil natural gas coal hydropower geothermal biofuel critical mineral and nuclear energy resources
14260,4,152,an afford able and reliable domestic energy supply is essential to the national and economic security of the united states as well as our foreign policy
14260,5,77,simply put americans are better off when the united states is energy dominant
14260,6,149,american energy dominance is threatened when state and local governments seek to regulate energy beyond their constitutional or statutory authorities
14260,7,252,for example when states target or discriminate against outofstate energy producers by imposing significant barriers to interstate and international trade american energy suffers and the equality of each state enshrined by the constitution is undermined
14260,8,218,similarly when states subject energy producers to arbitrary or excessive fines through retroactive penalties or seek to control energy development siting or production activities on federal land american energy suffers
14260,9,210,many states have enacted or are in the process of enacting burdensome and ideologically motivated climate change or energy policies that threaten american energy dominance and our economic and national security
14260,10,329,new york for example enacted a climate change extortion law that seeks to retroactively impose billions in fines erroneously labelled compensatory payments on traditional energy producers for their purported past contribu tions to greenhouse gas emissions not only in new york but also anywhere in the united states and the world
14260,11,145,vermont similarly extorts energy pro ducers for alleged past contributions to greenhouse gas emissions anywhere in the united states or the globe
14260,12,91,other states have taken different approaches in an effort to dictate national energy policy
14260,13,223,california for example punishes carbon use by adopting impossible caps on the amount of carbon businesses may use all but forcing businesses to pay large sums to trade carbon credits to meet californias radical requirements
14260,14,122,some states delay review of permit applications to produce energy creating de facto barriers to entry in the energy market
14260,15,147,states have also sued energy companies for supposed climate change harm under nuisance or other tort regimes that could result in crippling damages
14260,16,227,these state laws and policies weaken our national security and devastate americans by driving up energy costs for families coasttocoast despite some of these families not living or voting in states with these crippling policies
14260,17,122,these laws and policies also undermine federalism by projecting the regulatory preferences of a few states into all states
14260,18,176,americans must be permitted to heat their homes fuel their cars and have peace of mind free from policies that make energy more expensive and inevitably degrade quality of life
14260,19,291,these state laws and policies try to dictate interstate and international disputes over air water and natural resources unduly discriminate against outofstate businesses contravene the equality of states and retroactively impose arbitrary and excessive fines without legitimate justification
14260,20,123,these state laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my administrations objective to unleash american energy
14260,21,21,they should not stand
14260,22,31,state laws and causes of action
14260,23,403,a the attorney general in consultation with the heads of appropriate executive departments and agen cies shall identify all state and local laws regulations causes of action policies and practices collectively state laws burdening the identification development siting production or use of domestic energy resources that are or may be unconstitutional preempted by federal law or otherwise unenforceable

14257,6,127,trading partners economic policies that suppress domestic wages and con sumption as indicated by large and persistent annual us
14257,7,126,goods trade deficits constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national secu rity and economy of the united states
14257,8,194,that threat has its source in whole or substantial part outside the united states in the domestic economic policies of key trading partners and structural imbalances in the global trading system
14257,9,65,i hereby declare a national emergency with respect to this threat
14257,10,389,on january 20 2025 i signed the america first trade policy presidential memorandum directing my administration to investigate the causes of our countrys large and persistent annual trade deficits in goods including the economic and national security implications and risks resulting from such deficits and to undertake a review of and identify any unfair trade practices by other countries
14257,11,260,on february 13 2025 i signed a presidential memo randum entitled reciprocal trade and tariffs that directed further review of our trading partners nonreciprocal trading practices and noted the rela tionship between nonreciprocal practices and the trade deficit
14257,12,120,on april 1 2025 i received the final results of those investigations and i am taking action today based on those results
14257,13,30,large and persistent annual us
14257,14,256,goods trade deficits have led to the hollowing out of our manufacturing base inhibited our ability to scale advanced domestic manufacturing capacity undermined critical supply chains and rendered our defenseindustrial base dependent on foreign adver saries
14257,15,30,large and persistent annual us
14257,16,113,goods trade deficits are caused in substantial part by a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships
14257,17,103,this situation is evidenced by disparate tariff rates and nontariff barriers that make it harder for us
14257,18,55,manufacturers to sell their products in foreign markets
14257,19,55,it is also evidenced by the economic policies of key us
14257,20,98,trading partners insofar as they suppress domestic wages and consumption and thereby demand for us
14257,21,91,exports while artificially increasing the competitive ness of their goods in global markets
14257,22,107,these conditions have given rise to the national emergency that this order is intended to abate and resolve
14257,23,31,for decades starting in 1934 us
14257,24,67,trade policy has been organized around the principle of reciprocity
14257,25,188,the congress directed to secure reduced reciprocal tariff rates from key trading partners first through bilateral trade agreements and later under the auspices of the global trading system
14257,26,158,between 1934 and 1945 the executive branch negotiated and signed 32 bilateral reciprocal trade agreements designed to lower tariff rates on a reciprocal basis
14257,27,198,after 1947 through 1994 participating countries engaged in eight rounds of negotiation which resulted in the general agreements on tariffs and trade gatt and seven subsequent tariff reduction rounds
14257,28,194,however despite a commitment to the principle of reciprocity the trading relationship between the united states and its trading partners has become highly unbalanced particularly in recent years
14257,29,340,the postwar international economic system was based upon three incorrect assumptions first that if the united states led the world in liberalizing tariff and nontariff barriers the rest of the world would follow second that such liberalization would ultimately result in more economic convergence and increased domestic consumption among us
14257,30,170,trading partners converging towards the share in the united states and third that as a result the united states would not accrue large and persistent goods trade deficits
14257,31,215,this framework set in motion events agreements and commitments that did not result in reciprocity or generally increase domestic consumption in foreign economies relative to domestic consumption in the united states
14257,32,59,those events in turn created large and persistent annual us
14257,33,62,goods trade deficits as a feature of the global trading system
14257,34,300,put simply while world trade organization wto members agreed to bind their tariff rates on a mostfavorednation mfn basis and thereby provide their best tariff rates to all wto members they did not agree to bind their tariff rates at similarly low levels or to apply tariff rates on a reciprocal basis
14257,35,350,consequently according to the wto the united states has among the lowest simple average mfn tariff rates in the world at 33 percent while many of our key trading partners like brazil 112 percent china 75 percent the european union eu 5 percent india 17 percent and vietnam 94 percent have simple average mfn tariff rates that are significantly higher
14257,36,137,moreover these average mfn tariff rates conceal much larger discrepancies across economies in tariff rates applied to particular products
14257,37,239,for example the united states imposes a 25 percent tariff on passenger vehicle imports with internal combustion engines while the european union 10 percent india 70 percent and china 15 percent impose much higher duties on the same product
14257,38,140,for network switches and routers the united states imposes a 0 percent tariff but for similar products india 10 percent levies a higher rate
14257,39,115,brazil 18 percent and indonesia 30 percent impose a higher tariff on ethanol than does the united states 25 percent
14257,40,27,for rice in the husk the us
14257,41,145,mfn tariff is 27 percent ad valorem equivalent while india 80 percent malaysia 40 percent and turkey an average of 31 percent impose higher rates
14257,42,93,apples enter the united states dutyfree but not so in turkey 603 percent and india 50 percent
14257,43,44,similarly nontariff barriers also deprive us
14257,44,62,manufacturers of reciprocal access to markets around the world
14257,45,121,the 2025 national trade estimate report on foreign trade barriers nte details a great number of non tariff barriers to us
14257,46,68,exports around the world on a tradingpartner by tradingpartner basis
14257,47,857,these barriers include import barriers and licensing restrictions customs barriers and shortcomings in trade facilitation technical barriers to trade eg unnecessarily trade restrictive standards conformity assessment procedures or technical regulations sanitary and phytosanitary measures that unnecessarily restrict trade without furthering safety objectives inadequate patent copyright trade secret and trademark regimes and inad equate enforcement of intellectual property rights discriminatory licensing requirements or regulatory standards barriers to crossborder data flows and discriminatory practices affecting trade in digital products investment barriers subsidies anticompetitive practices discrimination in favor of do mestic stateowned enterprises and failures by governments in protecting labor and environment standards bribery and corruption
14257,48,269,moreover nontariff barriers include the domestic economic policies and practices of our trading partners including currency practices and value added taxes and their associated market distortions that suppress domestic consumption and boost exports to the united states
14257,49,288,this lack of reciprocity is apparent in the fact that the share of consumption to gross domestic product gdp in the united states is about 68 percent but it is much lower in others like ireland 27 percent singapore 31 percent china 39 percent south korea 49 percent and germany 50 percent
14257,50,86,at the same time efforts by the united states to address these imbalances have stalled
14257,51,188,trading partners have repeatedly blocked multilateral and plurilateral solutions including in the context of new rounds of tariff negotia tions and efforts to discipline nontariff barriers
14257,52,28,at the same time with the us
14257,53,45,economy disproportionately open to imports us
14257,54,78,trading partners have had few incentives to provide reciprocal treatment to us
14257,55,54,exports in the context of bilateral trade negotiations
14257,56,75,these structural asymmetries have driven the large and persistent annual us
14257,57,19,goods trade deficit
14257,58,151,even for countries with which the united states may enjoy an occasional bilateral trade surplus the accumulation of tariff and nontariff barriers on us
14257,59,83,exports may make that surplus smaller than it would have been without such barriers
14257,60,146,permitting these asymmetries to continue is not sustainable in todays economic and geopolitical environ ment because of the effect they have on us
14257,61,19,domestic production
14257,62,94,a nations ability to produce domestically is the bedrock of its national and economic security
14257,63,141,both my first administration in 2017 and the biden administration in 2022 recognized that increasing domestic manufacturing is critical to us
14257,64,17,national security
14257,65,40,according to 2023 united nations data us
14257,66,118,manufacturing output as a share of global manufacturing output was 174 percent down from a peak in 2001 of 284 percent
14257,67,38,over time the persistent decline in us
14257,68,35,manufacturing output has reduced us
14257,69,22,manufacturing capacity
14257,70,327,the need to maintain robust and resilient domestic manufacturing capacity is particularly acute in certain advanced industrial sectors like automobiles shipbuilding pharmaceuticals technology products machine tools and basic and fabricated metals because once competitors gain sufficient global market share in these sectors us
14257,71,41,produc tion could be permanently weakened
14257,72,204,it is also critical to scale manufacturing capacity in the defenseindustrial sector so that we can manufacture the defense materiel and equipment necessary to protect american interests at home and abroad
14257,73,95,in fact because the united states has supplied so much military equipment to other countries us
14257,74,65,stockpiles of military goods are too low to be compatible with us
14257,75,26,national defense interests
14257,76,14,furthermore us
14257,77,164,defense companies must develop new advanced manufacturing technologies across a range of critical sectors including biomanufacturing batteries and micro electronics
14257,78,302,if the united states wishes to maintain an effective security umbrella to defend its citizens and homeland as well as for its allies and partners it needs to have a large upstream manufacturing and goods producing ecosystem to manufacture these products without undue reliance on imports for key inputs
14257,79,73,increased reliance on foreign producers for goods also has compromised us
14257,80,33,economic security by rendering us
14257,81,70,supply chains vulnerable to geo political disruption and supply shocks
14257,82,43,in recent years the vulnerability of the us
14257,83,215,economy in this respect was exposed both during the covid 19 pandemic when americans had difficulty accessing essential products as well as when the houthi rebels later began attacking cargo ships in the middle east
14257,84,17,the decline of us
14257,85,39,manufacturing capacity threatens the us
14257,86,70,economy in other ways including through the loss of manufacturing jobs
14257,87,156,from 1997 to 2024 the united states lost around 5 million manufacturing jobs and experienced one of the largest drops in manufacturing employment in history
14257,88,90,furthermore many manufacturing job losses were concentrated in specific geographical areas
14257,89,209,in these areas the loss of manufacturing jobs contributed to the decline in rates of family formation and to the rise of other social trends like the abuse of opioids that have imposed profound costs on the us
14257,90,7,economy
14257,91,72,the future of american competitiveness depends on reversing these trends
14257,92,52,today manufacturing represents just 11 percent of us
14257,93,115,gross domestic product yet it accounts for 35 percent of american productivity growth and 60 percent of our exports
14257,94,14,importantly us
14257,95,168,manufacturing is the main engine of innovation in the united states responsible for 55 percent of all patents and 70 percent of all research and development rd spending
14257,96,35,the fact that rd expenditures by us
14257,97,293,multinational enterprises in china grew at an average rate of 136 percent a year between 2003 and 2017 while their rd expenditures in the united states grew by an average of just 5 percent per year during the same time period is evidence of the strong link between manufacturing and innovation
14257,98,127,furthermore every manufacturing job spurs 7 to 12 new jobs in other related industries helping to build and sustain our economy
14257,99,195,just as a nation that does not produce manufactured products cannot maintain the industrial base it needs for national security neither can a nation long survive if it cannot produce its own food
14257,100,278,presidential policy directive 21 of february 12 2013 critical infrastructure security and resilience designates food and agriculture as a critical infrastructure sector because it is one of the sectors considered so vital to the united states that its incapacity or destruction 
14257,101,271,would have a debilitating impact on security national economic security national public health or safety or any combina tion of those matters furthermore when i left office the united states had a trade surplus in agricultural products but today that surplus has vanished
14257,102,160,eviscerated by a slew of new nontariff barriers imposed by our trading partners it has been replaced by a projected 49 billion annual agricultural trade deficit
14257,103,54,for these reasons i hereby declare and order section 1
14257,104,18,national emergency
14257,105,128,as president of the united states my highest duty is ensuring the national and economic security of the country and its citizens
14257,106,104,i have declared a national emergency arising from conditions reflected in large and persistent annual us
14257,107,111,goods trade deficits which have grown by over 40 percent in the past 5 years alone reaching 12 trillion in 2024
14257,108,157,this trade deficit reflects asymmetries in trade relationships that have contributed to the atrophy of domestic production capacity especially that of the us
14257,109,40,manufacturing and defenseindustrial base
14257,110,32,these asymmetries also impact us
14257,111,74,producers ability to export and consequentially their incentive to produce
14257,112,231,specifically such asymmetry includes not only nonreciprocal differences in tariff rates among foreign trading partners but also extensive use of nontariff barriers by foreign trading partners which reduce the competitive ness of us
14257,113,75,exports while artificially enhancing the competitiveness of their own goods
14257,114,292,these nontariff barriers include technical barriers to trade nonscientific sanitary and phytosanitary rules inadequate intellectual prop erty protections suppressed domestic consumption eg wage suppression weak labor environmental and other regulatory standards and protections and corruption
14257,115,139,these nontariff barriers give rise to significant imbalances even when the united states and a trading partner have comparable tariff rates
14257,116,334,the cumulative effect of these imbalances has been the transfer of resources from domestic producers to foreign firms reducing opportunities for domestic manufacturers to expand and in turn leading to lost manufacturing jobs diminished manufacturing capacity and an atrophied industrial base includ ing in the defenseindustrial sector
14257,117,152,at the same time foreign firms are better positioned to scale production reinvest in innovation and compete in the global economy to the detriment of us
14257,118,30,economic and national security
14257,119,162,the absence of sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity in certain critical and advanced industrial sectorsanother outcome of the large and persistent annual us
14257,120,39,goods trade deficitsalso compromises us
14257,121,51,economic and na tional security by rendering the us
14257,122,49,economy less resilient to supply chain disruption
14257,123,38,finally the large persistent annual us
14257,124,233,goods trade deficits and the concomitant loss of industrial capacity have compromised military readiness this vulnerability can only be redressed through swift corrective action to rebalance the flow of imports into the united states
14257,125,136,such impact upon military readiness and our national security posture is especially acute with the recent rise in armed conflicts abroad
14257,126,142,i call upon the public and private sector to make the efforts necessary to strengthen the international economic position of the united states
14257,127,24,reciprocal tariff policy
14257,128,188,it is the policy of the united states to rebalance global trade flows by imposing an additional ad valorem duty on all imports from all trading partners except as otherwise provided herein
14257,129,271,the additional ad valorem duty on all imports from all trading partners shall start at 10 percent and shortly thereafter the additional ad valorem duty shall increase for trading partners enumerated in annex i to this order at the rates set forth in annex i to this order
14257,130,160,these additional ad valorem duties shall apply until such time as i determine that the underlying conditions described above are satisfied resolved or mitigated
14257,131,14,implementation
14257,132,206,a except as otherwise provided in this order all articles imported into the customs territory of the united states shall be consistent with law subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10 percent
14257,133,140,such rates of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after 1201 am
14257,134,158,eastern daylight time on april 5 2025 except that goods loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit before 1201 am

14253,1,57,restoring truth and sanity to american history  section 1
14253,2,18,purpose and policy
14253,3,201,over the past decade americans have wit nessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our nations history replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth
14253,4,174,this revisionist movement seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the united states by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light
14253,5,210,under this historical revision our nations unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty individual rights and human happiness is reconstructed as inherently racist sexist oppressive or otherwise irredeemably flawed
14253,6,286,rather than fostering unity and a deeper understanding of our shared past the widespread effort to rewrite history deepens societal divides and fosters a sense of national shame disregarding the progress america has made and the ideals that continue to inspire millions around the globe
14253,7,57,the prior administration advanced this corrosive ideology
14253,8,446,at independence national historical park in philadelphia pennsylvaniawhere our nation declared that all men are created equalthe prior administration sponsored training by an organization that advocates dismantling western foundations and interrogating institutional racism and pressured national historical park rangers that their racial identity should dictate how they convey history to visiting americans because america is purportedly racist
14253,9,207,once widely respected as a symbol of american excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement the smithsonian institution has in recent years come under the influence of a divisive racecentered ideology
14253,10,112,this shift has promoted narratives that portray american and western values as inherently harmful and oppressive
14253,11,793,for example the smithsonian amer ican art museum today features the shape of power stories of race and american sculpture an exhibit representing that societies including the united states have used race to establish and maintain systems of power privilege and disenfranchisement the exhibit further claims that sculpture has been a powerful tool in promoting scientific racism and promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct stating race is a human invention the national museum of african american history and culture has pro claimed that hard work individualism and the nuclear family are aspects of white culture the forthcoming smithsonian american womens history museum plans on celebrating the exploits of male athletes partici pating in womens sports
14253,12,29,these are just a few examples
14253,13,336,it is the policy of my administration to restore federal sites dedicated to history including parks and museums to solemn and uplifting public monuments that remind americans of our extraordinary heritage consistent progress toward becoming a more perfect union and unmatched record of advancing liberty prosperity and human flourishing
14253,14,181,museums in our nations capital should be places where individuals go to learnnot to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history
14253,15,286,to advance this policy we will restore the smithsonian institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and american greatnessigniting the imagination of young minds honoring the richness of american history and innovation and instilling pride in the hearts of all americans
14253,16,22,saving our smithsonian
14253,17,542,a the vice president in consultation with the assistant to for domestic policy and the special assistant to and senior associate staff secretary lindsey halligan esq shall work to effectuate the policies of this order through his role on the smithsonian board of regents with respect to the smithsonian institution and its museums education and research centers and the national zoo including by seeking to remove improper ideology from such properties and shall recommend to any additional actions necessary to fully effectuate such policies
14253,18,507,b the vice president and the director of the office of management and budget shall work with the congress to ensure that future appropriations to the smithsonian institution i prohibit expenditure on exhibits or programs that degrade shared amer ican values divide americans based on race or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy and ii celebrate the achievements of women in the american womens history museum and do not recognize men as women in any respect in the museum
14253,19,176,c the director of the office of management and budget and the secretary of the interior shall take any other measures within their authority to promote the policy of this order
14253,20,395,d as appropriate the vice president shall in consultation with the assistant to for domestic policy and special assistant to and senior associate staff secretary lindsey halligan esq work with the speaker of the house of representatives and the senate majority leader to seek the appointment of citizen members to the smithso nian board of regents committed to advancing the policy of this order

14253,22,258,the secretary of the interior shall provide sufficient funding as available to improve the infrastructure of independence national historical park which shall be complete by july 4 2026 the 250th anniversary of the signing of the declaration of independ ence
14253,23,35,restoring truth in american history
14253,24,549,a the secretary of the interior shall i determine whether since january 1 2020 public monuments memo rials statues markers or similar properties within the department of the interiors jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of american history inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures or include any other improper partisan ideology ii take action to reinstate the preexisting monuments memorials statues markers or similar properties as appropriate and consistent with 43 usc
14253,25,18,1451 et seq 54 usc
14253,26,588,100101 et seq and other applicable law and iii take action as appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that all public monuments memorials statues markers or similar properties within the department of the interiors jurisdiction do not con tain descriptions depictions or other content that inappropriately dispar age americans past or living including persons living in colonial times and instead focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the american people or with respect to natural features the beauty abundance and grandeur of the american landscape

14254,4,161,but it has become blighted by unscrupulous middlemen who sit at the intersection between artists and fans and impose egregious fees while providing minimal value
14254,5,296,ticket scalpers use bots and other unfair means to acquire large quantities of facevalue tickets and then resell them at an enormous markup on the secondary market price gouging consumers and depriving fans of the opportunity to see their favorite artists without incurring extraordinary expenses
14254,6,80,by some reports fans have paid as much as 70 times face value to obtain a ticket
14254,7,54,when this occurs the artists do not receive any profit
14254,8,61,all profits go solely to the scalper and the ticketing agency

14250,1,43,addressing risks from wilmerhale  section 1
14250,2,10,background
14250,3,194,my administration is committed to addressing the significant risks associated with law firms particularly socalled big law firms that engage in conduct detrimental to critical american interests
14250,4,186,many firms take actions that threaten public safety and national security limit constitutional freedoms degrade the quality of american elections or undermine bedrock american principles
14250,5,237,moreover law firms regularly conduct this harmful activity through their powerful pro bono practices earmarking hundreds of millions of their clients dollars for destructive causes that often directly or indirectly harm their own clients
14250,6,182,lawyers and law firms that engage in such egregious conduct should not have access to our nations secrets nor should such conduct be subsidized by federal taxpayer funds or contracts
14250,7,245,wilmer cutler pickering hale and dorr llp wilmerhale is yet another law firm that has abandoned the professions highest ideals and abused its pro bono practice to engage in activities that undermine justice and the interests of the united states
14250,8,423,for example wilmerhale engages in obvious partisan representations to achieve political ends supports efforts to discriminate on the basis of race backs the obstruction of efforts to prevent illegal aliens from committing horrific crimes and trafficking deadly drugs within our borders and furthers the degradation of the quality of american elections including by supporting efforts designed to enable non citizens to vote
14250,9,313,moreover wilmerhale itself discriminates against its employ ees based on race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws including through the use of racebased targets wilmerhale is also bent on employing lawyers who weaponize the prosecu torial power to upend the democratic process and distort justice
14250,10,289,for example wilmerhale rewarded robert mueller and his colleaguesaaron zebley muellers top aide and closest associate and james quarlesby wel coming them to the firm after they wielded the power of the federal govern ment to lead one of the most partisan investigations in american history
14250,11,360,muellers investigation epitomizes the weaponization of government yet wilmerhale claimed he embodies the highest value of our firm and profes sion muellers investigation upended the lives of public servants in my administration who were summoned before prosecutors with the effect of interfering in their ability to fulfill the mandates of my first term agenda
14250,12,80,this weaponization of the justice system must not be rewarded let alone condoned
14250,13,25,security clearance review
14250,14,359,a the attorney general the director of national intelligence and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies agencies shall immediately take steps consistent with applica ble law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at wilmerhale pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest

14250,19,164,b the heads of agencies shall review all contracts with wilmerhale or with entities that disclose doing business with wilmerhale under sub section a of this section
14250,20,603,to the extent permitted by law the heads of agencies shall i take appropriate steps to terminate any contract to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law including the federal acquisition regulation for which wilmerhale has been hired to perform any service and ii otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the united states with the goals and priorities of my administration as expressed in executive actions especially executive order 14147 of january 20 2025 ending the weaponization of the federal government and as heads of agencies deem appropriate
14250,21,333,within 30 days of the date of this order agencies shall submit to the director of the office of management and budget an assessment of contracts with wilmerhale or with entities that do business with wilmerhale effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order

14246,2,10,background
14246,3,194,my administration is committed to addressing the significant risks associated with law firms particularly socalled big law firms that engage in conduct detrimental to critical american interests
14246,4,186,many firms take actions that threaten public safety and national security limit constitutional freedoms degrade the quality of american elections or undermine bedrock american principles
14246,5,237,moreover law firms regularly conduct this harmful activity through their powerful pro bono practices earmarking hundreds of millions of their clients dollars for destructive causes that often directly or indirectly harm their own clients
14246,6,182,lawyers and law firms that engage in such egregious conduct should not have access to our nations secrets nor should such conduct be subsidized by federal taxpayer funds or contracts
14246,7,243,jenner  block llp jenner is yet another law firm that has abandoned the professions highest ideals condoned partisan lawfare and abused its pro bono practice to engage in activities that undermine justice and the interests of the united states
14246,8,334,for example jenner engages in obvious partisan representations to achieve political ends supports attacks against women and children based on a refusal to accept the biological reality of sex and backs the obstruction of efforts to prevent illegal aliens from committing horrific crimes and trafficking deadly drugs within our borders
14246,9,348,moreover jenner discriminates against its employees based on race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws including through the use of racebased targets in addition jenner was thrilled to rehire the unethical andrew weissmann after his time engaging in partisan prosecution as part of robert muellers entirely unjustified investigation

14248,1,72,preserving and protecting the integrity of american elections  section 1
14248,2,18,purpose and policy
14248,3,184,despite pioneering selfgovernment the united states now fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections employed by modern developed nations as well as those still developing
14248,4,157,india and brazil for example are tying voter identification to a biometric database while the united states largely relies on selfattestation for citizenship
14248,5,259,in tabulating votes germany and canada require use of paper ballots counted in public by local officials which substantially reduces the number of dis putes as compared to the american patchwork of voting methods that can lead to basic chainofcustody problems
14248,6,336,further while countries like den mark and sweden sensibly limit mailin voting to those unable to vote in person and do not count latearriving votes regardless of the date of postmark many american elections now feature mass voting by mail with many officials accepting ballots without postmarks or those received well after election day
14248,7,127,free fair and honest elections unmarred by fraud errors or suspicion are fundamental to maintaining our constitutional republic
14248,8,165,the right of american citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated without illegal dilution is vital to determining the rightful winner of an election
14248,9,250,under the constitution state governments must safeguard american elections in compliance with federal laws that protect americans voting rights and guard against dilution by illegal voting discrimination fraud and other forms of malfeasance and error
14248,10,211,yet the united states has not adequately enforced federal election requirements that for example prohibit states from counting ballots received after election day or prohibit noncitizens from registering to vote
14248,11,92,federal law establishes a uniform election day across the nation for federal elections 2 usc
14248,12,11,7 and 3 usc
14248,13,147,it is the policy of my administration to enforce those statutes and require that votes be cast and received by the election date established in law
14248,14,108,as the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit recently held in republican national committee v
14248,15,214,wetzel 2024 those statutes set the day by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials yet numerous states fail to comply with those laws by counting ballots received after election day
14248,16,175,this is like allowing persons who arrive 3 days after election day perhaps after a winner has been declared to vote in person at a former voting precinct which would be absurd
14248,17,37,several federal laws including 18 usc
14248,18,95,1015 and 611 prohibit foreign nationals from registering to vote or voting in federal elections
14248,19,191,yet states fail adequately to vet voters citizenship and in recent years the department of justice has failed to prioritize and devote sufficient resources for enforcement of these provisions
14248,20,105,even worse the prior administration actively prevented states from removing aliens from their voter lists
14248,21,73,additionally federal laws such as the national voter registration act pub
14248,22,39,10331 and the help america vote act pub
14248,23,119,107252 require states to maintain an accurate and current statewide list of every legally registered voter in the state
14248,24,136,and the department of homeland security is required to share database information with states upon request so they can fulfill this duty
14248,25,9,see 8 usc
14248,26,5,1373c
14248,27,160,maintaining accurate voter registra tion lists is a fundamental requirement in protecting voters from having their ballots voided or diluted by fraudulent votes
14248,28,18,federal law 52 usc
14248,29,133,30121 prohibits foreign nationals from participating in federal state or local elections by making any contributions or expendi tures
14248,30,217,but foreign nationals and nongovernmental organizations have taken advantage of loopholes in the laws interpretation spending millions of dollars through conduit contributions and ballotinitiativerelated expendi tures
14248,31,142,this type of foreign interference in our election process undermines the franchise and the right of american citizens to govern their republic
14248,32,65,above all elections must be honest and worthy of the public trust
14248,33,157,that requires voting methods that produce a voterverifiable paper record allowing voters to efficiently check their votes to protect against fraud or mistake
14248,34,56,electionintegrity standards must be modified accordingly

14249,2,7,purpose
14249,3,112,promoting financial integrity and operational efficiency are critical responsibilities of the federal government
14249,4,227,the federal govern ment processes trillions of dollars annually in disbursements to individuals businesses and organizations and in receipts from taxes fees and other payments to finance daily and longterm government operations
14249,5,135,these trans actions flow into and out of the united states general fund general fund which might be thought of as americas bank account
14249,6,210,in fiscal year 2024 339 trillion flowed into the general fund and 336 trillion flowed out of the account including 587 trillion less net interest in benefits grants loans vendor payments and other disbursements
14249,7,268,the department of the treasury is the largest financial payment manager of the federal government and is responsible for safeguarding the general fund but lacks sufficient controls to track transactions flowing through the general fund to determine if they were proper
14249,8,224,to enforce sufficient controls and ensure accountability to american taxpayers the department of the treasury requires financial information from executive departments and agencies agencies beyond what they currently provide
14249,9,94,financial fraud threatens the integrity of federal programs and undermines trust in government
14249,10,201,agencies past underinvestment in technology and longstanding challenges with access to accurate data has prevented them from more fully safeguarding taxpayer dollars against fraud and improper payments

14249,12,257,in addition to being an efficient steward of taxpayer funds the federal government on behalf of the american public must seek to ensure that financial information is accurate and that there is transparency with respect to how taxpayer dollars are being used

14249,14,179,in fiscal year 2024 ntdos were estimated to be responsible for 181 million payments totaling over 15 trillion approximately 22 percent of all federal government dollars dis bursed
14249,15,405,this fragmentation of disbursing authority together with the pro liferation of nonstandard financial management systems across the federal government leads to expensive disjointed and duplicative financial report ing lack of financial traceability complicated financial management opacity increased operational risks and decreased ability of the department of the treasury to provide centralized oversight
14249,16,201,this order promotes financial integrity by enabling the department of the treasury to more easily conduct improper payment and fraud prevention screening prior to disbursing funds on behalf of agencies

14242,1,162,improving education outcomes by empowering parents states and communities  and to enable parents teachers and communities to best ensure student success section 1
14242,2,18,purpose and policy
14242,3,131,our nations bright future relies on empow ered families engaged communities and excellent educational opportunities for every child
14242,4,231,unfortunately the experiment of controlling american edu cation through federal programs and dollarsand the unaccountable bu reaucracy those programs and dollars supporthas plainly failed our chil dren our teachers and our families
14242,5,175,taxpayers spent around 200 billion at the federal level on schools during the covid19 pandemic on top of the more than 60 billion they spend annually on federal school funding
14242,6,164,this money is largely distributed by one of the newest cabinet agencies the department of education which has existed for less than one fifth of our nations history
14242,7,274,the congress created the department of education in 1979 at the urging of president jimmy carter who received a firstever presidential endorsement from the countrys largest teachers union shortly after pledging to the union his support for a separate department of education
14242,8,161,since then the department of education has entrenched the education bureaucracy and sought to con vince america that federal control over education is beneficial
14242,9,170,while the department of education does not educate anyone it maintains a public relations office that includes over 80 staffers at a cost of more than 10 million per year
14242,10,133,closing the department of education would provide children and their families the opportunity to escape a system that is failing them
14242,11,63,today american reading and math scores are near historical lows
14242,12,170,this years national assessment of educational progress showed that 70 percent of 8th graders were below proficient in reading and 72 percent were below proficient in math
14242,13,48,the federal education bureaucracy is not working
14242,14,107,closure of the department of education would drastically improve program implementation in higher education
14242,15,100,the department of education currently manages a student loan debt portfolio of more than 16 trillion
14242,16,110,this means the federal student aid program is roughly the size of one of the nations largest banks wells fargo
14242,17,140,but although wells fargo has more than 200000 employees the department of education has fewer than 1500 in its office of federal student aid
14242,18,124,the department of education is not a bank and it must return bank functions to an entity equipped to serve americas students
14242,19,95,ultimately the department of educations main functions can and should be returned to the states
14242,20,73,closing the department of education and returning authority to the states
14242,21,358,a the secretary of education shall to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the department of education and return authority over education to the states and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninter rupted delivery of services programs and benefits on which americans rely
14242,22,469,b consistent with the department of educations authorities the secretary of education shall ensure that the allocation of any federal department of education funds is subject to rigorous compliance with federal law and administration policy including the requirement that any program or activity receiving federal assistance terminate illegal discrimination obscured under the label diversity equity and inclusion or similar terms and programs promoting gender ideology

14235,2,7,purpose
14235,3,290,in 2007 the congress established the public service loan forgiveness pslf program to encourage americans to enter the public service sector by promising to forgive their remaining student loans after they completed 10 years of service in those jobs while making 10 years of minimum payments
14235,4,191,the prior administration abused the pslf program through a waiver process using taxpayer funds to pay off loans for employees still years away from the statutorily required number of payments
14235,5,288,moreover instead of alleviating worker shortages in necessary occupations the pslf program has misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest but actually harm our national security and american values some times through criminal means
14235,6,426,the pslf program also creates perverse incentives that can increase the cost of tuition can load students in low need majors with unsustainable debt and may push students into organiza tions that hide under the umbrella of a nonprofit designation and degrade our national interest thus requiring additional federal funding to correct the negative societal effects caused by these organizations federally sub sidized wrongdoing
14235,7,382,as president of the united states i have a duty to protect preserve and defend the constitution and our national security which includes ending the subsidization of illegal activities including illegal immigration human smuggling child trafficking pervasive damage to public property and disrup tion of the public order which threaten the security and stability of the united states
14235,8,203,accordingly it is the policy of my administration that individ uals employed by organizations whose activities have a substantial illegal purpose shall not be eligible for public service loan forgiveness
14235,9,41,restoring public service loan forgiveness
14235,10,358,the secretary of education shall propose revisions to 34 cfr 685219 public service loan forgiveness program in coordination with the secretary of the treasury as appropriate that ensure the definition of public service excludes organizations that engage in activities that have a substantial illegal purpose including a aiding or abetting violations of 8 usc

14230,8,197,in addition to undermining democratic elections the integrity of our courts and honest law enforcement perkins coie racially discriminates against its own attorneys and staff and against applicants
14230,9,156,perkins coie publicly announced percentage quotas in 2019 for hiring and promotion on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws
14230,10,183,it proudly excluded applicants on the basis of race for its fellowships and it maintained these discriminatory practices until applicants harmed by them finally sued to enforce change

14221,1,129,making america healthy again by empowering patients with clear accurate and actionable healthcare pricing in formation  section 1
14221,2,7,purpose
14221,3,127,during my first term my administration took historic steps to correct a fundamental wrong within the american healthcare system
14221,4,230,for far too long prices were hidden from patients and employers with inadequate recourse available to individuals looking to shop for care or obtain pricing information from a healthcare provider in advance of a visit or procedure
14221,5,278,these opaque pricing arrangements allowed powerful entities such as hospitals and insurance companies to operate with insufficient accountability regarding their pricing practices resulting in patients employ ers and taxpayers shouldering the burden of inflated healthcare costs
14221,6,314,pursuant to executive order 13877 of june 24 2019 improving price and quality transparency in american healthcare to put patients first my administration issued paradigmshifting regulations to put patients first by requiring hospitals and health plans to deliver meaningful price information to the american people
14221,7,540,these regulations require hospitals to maintain a consumerfriendly display of pricing information for up to 300 shoppable services and a machinereadable file with negotiated rates for every single service the hospital provides health plans to post their negotiated rates with providers as well as their outofnetwork payments to providers and the actual prices they or their pharmacy benefit manager pay for prescription drugs and health plans to maintain a consumerfacing internet tool through which individuals can access price information
14221,8,199,one economic analysis from 2023 estimated the impact of these regulations if fully implemented could result in as much as 80 billion in healthcare savings for consumers employers and insurers by 2025
14221,9,161,another report from 2024 suggested healthcare price transparency could help employers reduce healthcare costs by 27 percent across 500 common healthcare services
14221,10,200,recent data has found the top 25 percent of most expensive healthcare service prices have dropped by 63 percent per year following the initial implementation of price transparency during my first term
14221,11,108,unfortunately progress on price transparency at the federal level has stalled since the end of my first term
14221,12,138,hospitals and health plans were not adequately held to account when their price transparency data was incomplete or not even posted at all
14221,13,239,the biden administration failed to take sufficient steps to fully enforce my administrations requirement that would end the opaque nature of drug prices by ensuring health plans publicly post the true prices they pay for prescription drugs
14221,14,34,the american people deserve better
14221,15,143,making america healthy again will require empowering individuals with the best information possible to inform their life and healthcare choices
14221,16,227,by building on the historic efforts of my first term my administration will make more meaningful price informa tion available to patients to support a more competitive innovative afford able and higher quality healthcare system
14221,17,6,policy
14221,18,148,it is the policy of the united states to put patients first and ensure they have the information they need to make wellinformed healthcare decisions
14221,19,423,the federal government will continue to promote universal access to clear and accurate healthcare prices and will take all necessary steps to improve existing price transparency requirements increase enforcement of price transparency requirements and identify opportunities to further empower patients with meaningful price information potentially including through the expansion of existing price transparency requirements
14221,20,46,fulfilling the promise of radical transparency
14221,21,749,the secretary of the treasury the secretary of labor and the secretary of health and human services shall take all necessary and appropriate action to rapidly implement and enforce the healthcare price transparency regulations issued pursuant to executive order 13877 including within 90 days of the date of this order action to a require the disclosure of the actual prices of items and services not estimates b issue updated guidance or proposed regulatory action ensuring pricing information is standardized and easily comparable across hospitals and health plans and c issue guidance or proposed regulatory action updating enforcement policies designed to ensure compliance with the transparent reporting of complete accurate and meaningful data

14212,2,7,purpose
14212,3,188,american life expectancy significantly lags behind other developed countries with precovid19 united states life expectancy aver aging 788 years and comparable countries averaging 826 years
14212,4,77,this equates to 125 billion fewer life years for the united states population
14212,5,102,six in 10 americans have at least one chronic disease and four in 10 have two or more chronic diseases
14212,6,73,an estimated one in five united states adults lives with a mental illness
14212,7,86,these realities become even more painful when contrasted with nations around the globe
14212,8,154,across 204 countries and territories the united states had the highest agestandardized incidence rate of cancer in 2021 nearly double the nexthighest rate
14212,9,141,further from 19902021 the united states experienced an 88 percent increase in cancer the largest percentage increase of any country evaluated
14212,10,100,in 2021 asthma was more than twice as common in the united states than most of europe asia or africa
14212,11,112,autism spectrum disorders had the highest prevalence in highincome countries including the united states in 2021
14212,12,179,similarly autoimmune diseases such as inflam matory bowel disease psoriasis and multiple sclerosis are more commonly diagnosed in highincome areas such as europe and north america
14212,13,136,overall the global comparison data demonstrates that the health of americans is on an alarming trajectory that requires immediate action
14212,14,50,this concern applies urgently to americas children
14212,15,136,in 2022 an estimated 30 million children 407 percent had at least one health condition such as allergies asthma or an autoimmune disease
14212,16,185,autism spectrum disorder now affects 1 in 36 children in the united statesa staggering increase from rates of 1 to 4 out of 10000 children identified with the condition during the 1980s
14212,17,193,eighteen percent of late adolescents and young adults have fatty liver disease close to 30 percent of adolescents are prediabetic and more than 40 percent of adolescents are overweight or obese
14212,18,98,these health burdens have continued to increase alongside the increased prescription of medication
14212,19,275,for example in the case of attention deficit disorderattention deficit hyperactivity disorder over 34 million children are now on medication for the disorderup from 32 million children in 20192020and the number of children being diagnosed with the condition continues to rise
14212,20,67,this poses a dire threat to the american people and our way of life

14212,22,131,ninety percent of the nations 45 trillion in annual healthcare expenditures is for people with chronic and mental health conditions
14212,23,123,in short americans of all ages are becoming sicker beset by illnesses that our medical system is not addressing effectively
14212,24,49,these trends harm us our economy and our security
14212,25,228,to fully address the growing health crisis in america we must redirect our national focus in the public and private sectors toward understanding and drastically lowering chronic disease rates and ending childhood chronic disease
14212,26,219,this includes fresh thinking on nutrition physical activity healthy lifestyles overreliance on medication and treatments the effects of new technological habits environmental impacts and food and drug quality and safety
14212,27,174,we must restore the integrity of the scientific process by protecting expert recommendations from inappropriate influence and increasing trans parency regarding existing data
14212,28,86,we must ensure our healthcare system promotes health rather than just managing disease
14212,29,6,policy

14212,31,126,to do so executive departments and agencies agencies that address health or healthcare must focus on reversing chronic disease
14212,32,756,under this policy a all federally funded health research should empower americans through transparency and opensource data and should avoid or eliminate conflicts of interest that skew outcomes and perpetuate distrust b the national institutes of health and other healthrelated research funded by the federal government should prioritize goldstandard research on the root causes of why americans are getting sick c agencies shall work with farmers to ensure that united states food is the healthiest most abundant and most affordable in the world and d agencies shall ensure the availability of expanded treatment options and the flexibility for health insurance coverage to provide benefits that support beneficial lifestyle changes and disease prevention

14207,6,121,johnson more than 50 years ago is a government program purportedly designed to provide leadership training to bureaucrats

14202,3,168,it is the policy of the united states and the purpose of this order to protect the religious freedoms of americans and end the antichristian weaponization of government
14202,4,150,the founders estab lished a nation in which people were free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation by their government
14202,5,122,for that reason the united states constitution enshrines the fundamental right to religious liberty in the first amendment
14202,6,81,federal laws like the religious freedom restoration act of 1993 as amended 42 usc
14202,7,103,2000bb et seq further prohibit government interference with americans rights to exercise their religion
14202,8,59,title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 as amended 42 usc
14202,9,142,2000e et seq prohibits religious discrimination in employment while federal hatecrime laws prohibit offenses committed due to religious animus
14202,10,142,yet the previous administration engaged in an egregious pattern of targeting peaceful christians while ignoring violent antichristian offenses
14202,11,283,the biden department of justice sought to squelch faith in the public square by bringing federal criminal charges and obtaining in numerous cases multiyear prison sentences against nearly two dozen peaceful prolife christians for praying and demonstrating outside abortion facilities

14202,13,79,i rectified this injustice on january 23 2025 by issuing pardons in these cases
14202,14,187,at the same time catholic churches charities and prolife centers sought justice for violence theft and arson perpetrated against them which the biden department of justice largely ignored
14202,15,34,after more than 100 attacks the us
14202,16,128,house of representatives passed a resolution condemning this violence and calling on the biden administration to enforce the law
14202,17,306,then in 2023 a federal bureau of investigation fbi memorandum asserted that radicaltraditionalist catholics were domesticterrorism threats and suggested infiltrating catholic churches as threat mitigation this later retracted fbi memorandum cited as support evidence propaganda from highly partisan sources
14202,18,129,the biden department of education sought to repeal religiousliberty protec tions for faithbased organizations on college campuses
14202,19,135,the biden equal employment opportunity commission sought to force christians to affirm radical transgender ideology against their faith
14202,20,190,and the biden department of health and human services sought to drive christians who do not conform to certain beliefs on sexual orientation and gender identity out of the foster care system
14202,21,323,the biden administration declared march 31 2024easter sundayas transgender day of visibility in this atmosphere of antichristian government hostility and vandalism against christian churches and places of worship surged with the number of such identified acts in 2023 exceeding by more than eight times the number from 2018
14202,22,124,catholic churches and institutions have been aggressively targeted with hundreds of acts of hostility violence and vandalism
14202,23,119,my administration will not tolerate antichristian weaponization of govern ment or unlawful conduct targeting christians
14202,24,168,the law protects the freedom of americans and groups of americans to practice their faith in peace and my administration will enforce the law and protect these freedoms

14203,5,222,trump president of the united states of america find that the international criminal court icc as established by the rome statute has engaged in illegitimate and baseless actions targeting america and our close ally israel
14203,6,353,the icc has without a legitimate basis asserted jurisdiction over and opened preliminary investigations concerning personnel of the united states and certain of its allies including israel and has further abused its power by issuing baseless arrest warrants targeting israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and former minister of defense yoav gallant
14203,7,131,the icc has no jurisdiction over the united states or israel as neither country is party to the rome statute or a member of the icc
14203,8,155,neither country has ever recognized the iccs jurisdiction and both nations are thriving democracies with militaries that strictly adhere to the laws of war
14203,9,261,the iccs recent actions against israel and the united states set a dangerous precedent directly endangering current and former united states personnel including active service members of the armed forces by expos ing them to harassment abuse and possible arrest
14203,10,225,this malign conduct in turn threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the united states and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the united states government and our allies including israel
14203,11,98,furthermore in 2002 the congress enacted the american servicemembers protection act of 2002 22 usc
14203,12,560,7421 et seq to protect united states military per sonnel united states officials and officials and military personnel of certain allied countries against criminal prosecution by an international criminal court to which the united states is not party stating in addition to exposing members of the armed forces of the united states to the risk of international criminal prosecution the rome statute creates a risk that and other senior elected and appointed officials of the united states govern ment may be prosecuted by the international criminal court 22 usc
14203,13,5,74219
14203,14,203,the united states unequivocally opposes and expects our allies to oppose any icc actions against the united states israel or any other ally of the united states that has not consented to icc jurisdiction
14203,15,333,the united states remains committed to accountability and to the peaceful cultivation of inter national order but the icc and parties to the rome statute must respect the decisions of the united states and other countries not to subject their personnel to the iccs jurisdiction consistent with their respective sovereign prerogatives
14203,16,406,the united states will impose tangible and significant consequences on those responsible for the iccs transgressions some of which may include the blocking of property and assets as well as the suspension of entry into the united states of icc officials employees and agents as well as their immediate family members as their entry into our nation would be detrimental to the interests of the united states
14203,17,325,i therefore determine that any effort by the icc to investigate arrest detain or prosecute protected persons as defined in section 8d of this order constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the united states and i hereby declare a national emergency to address that threat

14193,6,50,this challenge threatens the fabric of our society
14193,7,127,gang members smugglers human traffickers and illicit drugs of all kinds have poured across our borders and into our communities
14193,8,235,canada has played a central role in these challenges including by failing to devote sufficient attention and resources or meaningfully coordinate with united states law enforcement partners to effectively stem the tide of illicit drugs
14193,9,277,drug trafficking organizations dtos are the worlds leading producers of fentanyl methamphetamine cocaine and other illicit drugs and they cul tivate process and distribute massive quantities of narcotics that fuel addic tion and violence in communities across the united states
14193,10,175,these dtos often collaborate with transnational cartels to smuggle illicit drugs into the united states utilizing clandestine airstrips maritime routes and over land corridors
14193,11,135,the challenges at our southern border are foremost in the public conscious ness but our northern border is not exempt from these issues
14193,12,141,criminal networks are implicated in human trafficking and smuggling operations enabling unvetted illegal migration across our northern border
14193,13,108,there is also a growing presence of mexican cartels operating fentanyl and nitazene synthesis labs in canada
14193,14,590,the flow of illicit drugs like fentanyl to the united states through both illicit distribution networks and international maildue in the case of the latter to the existing administrative exemption from duty and taxes also known as de minimis under section 1321 of title 19 united states codehas created a public health crisis in the united states as outlined in ial memorandum of january 20 2025 america first trade policy and executive order 14157 of january 20 2025 designating cartels and other organizations as foreign terrorist orga nizations and specially designated global terrorists
14193,15,384,with respect to smug gling of illicit drugs across our northern border canadas financial trans actions and reports analysis centre recently published a study on the laundering of proceeds of illicit synthetic opioids which recognized canadas heightened domestic production of fentanyl largely from british columbia and its growing footprint within international narcotics distribution
14193,16,159,despite a north american dialogue on the public health impacts of illicit drugs since 2016 canadian officials have acknowledged that the problem has only grown
14193,17,12,and while us
14193,18,277,customs and border protection cbp within the department of homeland security seized comparatively much less fentanyl from canada than from mexico last year fentanyl is so potent that even a very small parcel of the drug can cause many deaths and destruction to america families
14193,19,105,in fact the amount of fentanyl that crossed the northern border last year could kill 95 million americans
14193,20,173,immediate action is required to finally end this public health crisis and national emergency which will not happen unless the compliance and cooperation of canada is assured
14193,21,38,i hereby determine and order section 1

14195,5,306,trump president of the united states of america find that the sustained influx of synthetic opioids has profound consequences on our nation including by killing approximately two hundred americans per day putting a severe strain on our healthcare system ravaging our communities and destroying our families
14195,6,101,synthetic opioid overdose is the leading cause of death for people aged 18 to 45 in the united states
14195,7,156,during my first term i took steps to end the direct flow of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids from the peoples republic of china prc to the united states
14195,8,315,since then the chinese communist party ccp which exerts ultimate control over the government and enterprises of the prc has sub sidized and otherwise incentivized prc chemical companies to export fentanyl and related precursor chemicals that are used to produce synthetic opioids sold illicitly in the united states
14195,9,203,furthermore the prc provides support to and safe haven for prcorigin transnational criminal organizations tcos that launder the revenues from the production shipment and sale of illicit synthetic opioids
14195,10,126,these prc origin tcos coordinate and communicate using prc social media software applications in the conduct of their business
14195,11,146,many prcbased chemical companies also go to great lengths to evade law enforcement and hide illicit substances in the flow of legitimate com merce
14195,12,249,some of the techniques employed by these prcbased companies to conceal the true contents of the parcels and the identity of the distributors include the use of reshippers in the united states false invoices fraudulent postage and deceptive packaging
14195,13,237,while more than 500000 pounds of drugs have been seized at the southern border each of the last 3 fiscal years in addition more than 42000 pounds of drugs have been seized at the northern border each year on average over the last 3 years
14195,14,120,illicit drugs kill tens of thousands of americans each year including 75000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone
14195,15,75,the influx of these drugs to our nation threatens the fabric of our society
14195,16,231,the prc plays a central role in this challenge not merely by failing to stem the ultimate source of many illicit drugs distributed in the united states but by actively sustaining and expanding the business of poisoning our citizens
14195,17,540,the flow of contraband drugs like fentanyl to the united states through illicit distribution networks has created a national emergency including a public health crisis in the united states as outlined in ial memorandum of january 20 2025 america first trade policy proclamation 10886 of january 20 2025 declaring a national emergency at the southern border of the united states and executive order 14157 of january 20 designating cartels and other organizations as foreign terrorist orga nizations and specially designated global terrorists
14195,18,278,despite multiple attempts to resolve this crisis at its root source through bilateral dialogue prc officials have failed to follow through with the deci sive actions needed to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to known criminal cartels and shut down the money laundering tcos
14195,19,156,the prc imple ments the most sophisticated domestic surveillance network coupled with the most comprehensive domestic law enforcement apparatus in the world
14195,20,137,the prc also routinely exerts extraterritorial reach across the globe to threat en harass and suppress what it views as political dissent
14195,21,127,as such the ccp does not lack the capacity to severely blunt the global illicit opioid epidemic it simply is unwilling to do so
14195,22,274,immediate action is required to address the national emergency i declared and to finally end this emergency including the public health crisis caused by opioid use and addiction which will not happen until the full compliance and cooperation of the prc government is assured
14195,23,38,i hereby determine and order section 1

14190,1,57,ending radical indoctrination in k12 schooling  section 1
14190,2,18,purpose and policy
14190,3,180,parents trust americas schools to provide their children with a rigorous education and to instill a patriotic admiration for our incredible nation and the values for which we stand
14190,4,164,in recent years however parents have witnessed schools indoctrinate their children in radical antiamerican ideologies while deliberately blocking parental oversight
14190,5,144,such an environment operates as an echo chamber in which students are forced to accept these ideologies without question or critical examination
14190,6,166,in many cases innocent children are compelled to adopt identities as either victims or oppressors solely based on their skin color and other immutable characteristics
14190,7,176,in other instances young men and women are made to question whether they were born in the wrong body and whether to view their parents and their reality as enemies to be blamed
14190,8,168,these practices not only erode critical thinking but also sow division confusion and distrust which undermine the very foundations of personal identity and family unity
14190,9,204,imprinting antiamerican subversive harmful and false ideologies on our nations children not only violates longstanding antidiscrimination civil rights law in many cases but usurps basic parental authority
14190,10,449,for example steering students toward surgical and chemical mutilation without parental consent or involvement or allowing males access to private spaces designated for females may contravene federal laws that protect parental rights includ ing the family educational rights and privacy act ferpa and the protec tion of pupil rights amendment ppra and sexbased equality and oppor tunity including title ix of the education amendments of 1972 title ix
14190,11,141,similarly demanding acquiescence to white privilege or unconscious bias actually promotes racial discrimination and undermines national unity
14190,12,282,my administration will enforce the law to ensure that recipients of federal funds providing k12 education comply with all applicable laws prohibiting discrimination in various contexts and protecting parental rights including title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 title vi 42 usc

14183,1,191,prioritizing military excellence and readiness  and as commander in chief of the armed forces of the united states and to ensure the readiness and effective ness of our armed forces section 1
14183,2,7,purpose
14183,3,149,the united states military has a clear mission to protect the american people and our homeland as the worlds most lethal and effective fighting force
14183,4,238,success in this existential mission requires a singular focus on developing the requisite warrior ethos and the pursuit of military excellence cannot be diluted to accommodate political agendas or other ideologies harmful to unit cohesion
14183,5,220,recently however the armed forces have been afflicted with radical gender ideology to appease activists unconcerned with the requirements of military service like physical and mental health selflessness and unit cohesion
14183,6,575,longstanding department of defense dod policy dod instruction dodi 613003 provides that it is the policy of the dod to ensure that service members are free of medical conditions or physical defects that may reasonably be expected to require excessive time lost from duty for necessary treatment or hospitalization as a result many mental and physical health conditions are incompatible with active duty from conditions that require substantial medication or medical treatment to bipolar and related disorders eating disorders suicidality and prior psychiatric hospitalization
14183,7,202,consistent with the military mission and longstanding dod policy expressing a false gender identity divergent from an individuals sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service
14183,8,245,beyond the hormonal and surgical medical interventions involved adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individuals sex conflicts with a soldiers commitment to an honorable truthful and disciplined lifestyle even in ones personal life
14183,9,170,a mans assertion that he is a woman and his requirement that others honor this falsehood is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member
14183,10,161,for the sake of our nation and the patriotic americans who volunteer to serve it military service must be reserved for those mentally and physically fit for duty
14183,11,228,the armed forces must adhere to high mental and physical health standards to ensure our military can deploy fight and win including in austere conditions and without the benefit of routine medical treatment or special provisions
14183,12,6,policy
14183,13,157,it is the policy of the united states government to establish high standards for troop readiness lethality cohesion honesty humility uniformity and integrity
14183,14,121,this policy is inconsistent with the medical sur gical and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria

14168,1,168,defending women from gender ideology extremism and re storing biological truth to the federal government  including section 7301 of title 5 united states code section 1
14168,2,7,purpose
14168,3,314,across the country ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to selfidentify as women and gain access to intimate single sex spaces and activities designed for women from womens domestic abuse shelters to womens workplace showers
14168,4,13,this is wrong
14168,5,133,efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity safety and wellbeing
14168,6,132,the erasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women but on the validity of the entire american system
14168,7,116,basing federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry public safety morale and trust in government itself
14168,8,292,this unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful attack against the ordinary and longstanding use and understanding of biological and scientific terms replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal fluid and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts
14168,9,284,invalidating the true and biological category of woman improperly trans forms laws and policies designed to protect sexbased opportunities into laws and policies that undermine them replacing longstanding cherished legal rights and values with an identitybased inchoate social concept
14168,10,214,accordingly my administration will defend womens rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female and men are biologically male
14168,11,22,policy and definitions
14168,12,76,it is the policy of the united states to recognize two sexes male and female
14168,13,91,these sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality
14168,14,330,under my direc tion the executive branch will enforce all sexprotective laws to promote this reality and the following definitions shall govern all executive interpre tation of and application of federal law and administration policy a sex shall refer to an individuals immutable biological classification as either male or female
14168,15,168,sex is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of gender identity b women or woman and girls or girl shall mean adult and juvenile human females respectively
14168,16,83,c men or man and boys or boy shall mean adult and juvenile human males respectively
14168,17,100,d female means a person belonging at conception to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell
14168,18,99,e male means a person belonging at conception to the sex that pro duces the small reproductive cell
14168,19,286,f gender ideology replaces the biological category of sex with an evershifting concept of selfassessed gender identity permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true
14168,20,110,gender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from ones sex
14168,21,202,gender ideology is internally incon sistent in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body
14168,22,265,g gender identity reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an infinite continuum that does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex
14168,23,52,recognizing women are biologically distinct from men
14168,24,109,a within 30 days of the date of this order the secretary of health and human services shall provide to the us
14168,25,120,government external partners and the public clear guidance expanding on the sexbased definitions set forth in this order
14168,26,185,b each agency and all federal employees shall enforce laws governing sexbased rights protections opportunities and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes
14168,27,268,each agency should therefore give the terms sex male female men women boys and girls the meanings set forth in section 2 of this order when interpreting or applying statutes regulations or guidance and in all other official agency business documents and communications
14168,28,238,c when administering or enforcing sexbased distinctions every agency and all federal employees acting in an official capacity on behalf of their agency shall use the term sex and not gender in all applicable federal policies and documents
14168,29,491,d the secretaries of state and homeland security and the director of the office of personnel management shall implement changes to require that governmentissued identification documents including passports visas and global entry cards accurately reflect the holders sex as defined under section 2 of this order and the director of the office of personnel manage ment shall ensure that applicable personnel records accurately report federal employees sex as defined by section 2 of this order
14168,30,274,e agencies shall remove all statements policies regulations forms com munications or other internal and external messages that promote or other wise inculcate gender ideology and shall cease issuing such statements policies regulations forms communications or other messages
14168,31,108,agency forms that require an individuals sex shall list male or female and shall not request gender identity
14168,32,105,agencies shall take all necessary steps as permitted by law to end the federal funding of gender ideology
14168,33,79,f the prior administration argued that the supreme courts decision in bostock v
14168,34,196,clayton county 2020 which addressed title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 requires gender identitybased access to single sex spaces under for example title ix of the educational amendments act
14168,35,55,this position is legally untenable and has harmed women
14168,36,149,the attorney general shall therefore immediately issue guidance to agencies to correct the misapplication of the supreme courts decision in bostock v
14168,37,65,clayton county 2020 to sexbased distinctions in agency activities
14168,38,185,in addition the attorney general shall issue guidance and assist agencies in protecting sexbased distinctions which are explicitly permitted under constitutional and statutory precedent
14168,39,60,g federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology

14168,41,26,privacy in intimate spaces
14168,42,324,a the attorney general and secretary of homeland security shall ensure that males are not detained in womens prisons or housed in womens detention centers including through amend ment as necessary of part 11541 of title 28 code of federal regulations and interpretation guidance regarding the americans with disabilities act
14168,43,388,b the secretary of housing and urban development shall prepare and submit for notice and comment rulemaking a policy to rescind the final rule entitled equal access in accordance with an individuals gender identity in community planning and development programs of september 21 2016 81 fr 64763 and shall submit for public comment a policy protecting women seeking singlesex rape shelters
14168,44,316,c the attorney general shall ensure that the bureau of prisons revises its policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order and shall ensure that no federal funds are expended for any medical procedure treatment or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmates appearance to that of the opposite sex
14168,45,201,d agencies shall effectuate this policy by taking appropriate action to ensure that intimate spaces designated for women girls or females or for men boys or males are designated by sex and not identity

14168,47,217,the attorney general shall issue guidance to ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to singlesex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by the civil rights act of 1964
14168,48,335,in accordance with that guidance the attorney general the secretary of labor the general counsel and chair of the equal employment opportunity commission and each other agency head with enforcement responsibilities under the civil rights act shall prioritize inves tigations and litigation to enforce the rights and freedoms identified

14163,7,126,even major urban centers such as new york city chicago and denver have sought federal aid to manage the burden of new arrivals
14163,8,130,some jurisdictions like new york and massachusetts have even recently declared states of emergency because of increased migra tion
14163,9,298,the united states lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants and in particular refugees into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for americans that protects their safety and security and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees

14164,1,67,restoring the death penalty and protecting public safety  section 1
14164,2,7,purpose
14164,3,168,capital punishment is an essential tool for deterring and punishing those who would commit the most heinous crimes and acts of lethal violence against american citizens
14164,4,212,before during and after the founding of the united states our cities states and country have continu ously relied upon capital punishment as the ultimate deterrent and only proper punishment for the vilest crimes
14164,5,112,our founders knew well that only capital punishment can bring justice and restore order in response to such evil
14164,6,86,for this and other reasons capital punishment continues to enjoy broad popular support
14164,7,119,yet for too long politicians and judges who oppose capital punishment have defied and subverted the laws of our country
14164,8,150,at every turn they seek to thwart the execution of lawfully imposed capital sentences and choose to enforce their personal beliefs rather than the law
14164,9,233,when president biden took office in 2021 he allowed his department of justice to issue a moratorium on federal executions in defiance of his duty to faithfully execute the laws of the united states that provide for capital punishment
14164,10,279,and on december 23 2024 president biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 most vile and sadistic rapists child molesters and murderers on federal death row remorseless criminals who brutalized young children strangled and drowned their victims and hunted strangers for sport
14164,11,152,he commuted their sentences even though the laws of our nation have always protected victims by applying capital punishment to barbaric acts like theirs
14164,12,222,judges who oppose capital punishment have likewise disregarded the law by falsely claiming that capital punishment is unconstitutional even though the constitution explicitly acknowledges the legality of capital punishment
14164,13,159,these efforts to subvert and undermine capital punishment defy the laws of our nation make a mockery of justice and insult the victims of these horrible crimes
14164,14,282,the governments most solemn responsibility is to protect its citizens from abhorrent acts and my administration will not tolerate efforts to stymie and eviscerate the laws that authorize capital punishment against those who commit horrible acts of violence against american citizens
14164,15,6,policy
14164,16,267,it is the policy of the united states to ensure that the laws that authorize capital punishment are respected and faithfully imple mented and to counteract the politicians and judges who subvert the law by obstructing and preventing the execution of capital sentences
14164,17,26,federal capital punishment
14164,18,100,a the attorney general shall pursue the death penalty for all crimes of a severity demanding its use

14164,23,180,the attorney general shall further evaluate wheth er these offenders can be charged with state capital crimes and shall rec ommend appropriate action to state and local authorities
14164,24,43,preserving capital punishment in the states

14165,6,191,deadly narcotics and other illicit materials have flowed across the border while agents and officers spend their limited resources processing illegal aliens for release into the united states
14165,7,241,these catchandrelease policies undermine the rule of law and our sovereignty create substantial risks to public safety and security and divert critical resources away from stopping the entry of contraband and fugitives into the united states

14156,2,71,1601 et seq nea and section 301 of title 3 united states code section 1
14156,3,7,purpose
14156,4,207,the energy and critical minerals energy identification leasing development production transportation refining and generation capacity of the united states are all far too inadequate to meet our nations needs
14156,5,214,we need a reliable diversified and affordable supply of energy to drive our nations manufacturing transportation agriculture and defense industries and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness
14156,6,256,caused by the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administra tion our nations inadequate energy supply and infrastructure causes and makes worse the high energy prices that devastate americans particularly those living on low and fixedincomes
14156,7,163,this active threat to the american people from high energy prices is exacer bated by our nations diminished capacity to insulate itself from hostile foreign actors
14156,8,72,energy security is an increasingly crucial theater of global competition
14156,9,262,in an effort to harm the american people hostile state and nonstate foreign actors have targeted our domestic energy infrastructure weaponized our reliance on foreign energy and abused their ability to cause dramatic swings within international commodity markets
14156,10,135,an afford able and reliable domestic supply of energy is a fundamental requirement for the national and economic security of any nation
14156,11,191,the integrity and expansion of our nations energy infrastructurefrom coast to coastis an immediate and pressing priority for the protection of the united states national and economic security
14156,12,114,it is imperative that the federal government puts the physical and economic wellbeing of the american people first
14156,13,200,moreover the united states has the potential to use its unrealized energy resources domestically and to sell to international allies and partners a reliable diversified and affordable supply of energy
14156,14,278,this would create jobs and economic prosperity for americans forgotten in the present econ omy improve the united states trade balance help our country compete with hostile foreign powers strengthen relations with allies and partners and support international peace and security
14156,15,118,accordingly our nations dangerous energy situation inflicts unnecessary and perilous constraints on our foreign policy
14156,16,225,the policies of the previous administration have driven our nation into a national emergency where a precariously inadequate and intermittent energy supply and an increasingly unreliable grid require swift and decisive action
14156,17,186,without immediate remedy this situation will dramatically deterio rate in the near future due to a high demand for energy and natural resources to power the next generation of technology
14156,18,168,the united states ability to remain at the forefront of technological innovation depends on a reliable supply of energy and the integrity of our nations electrical grid
14156,19,214,our nations current inadequate development of domestic energy resources leaves us vul nerable to hostile foreign actors and poses an imminent and growing threat to the united states prosperity and national security
14156,20,286,these numerous problems are most pronounced in our nations northeast and west coast where dangerous state and local policies jeopardize our nations core national defense and security needs and devastate the pros perity of not only local residents but the entire united states population
14156,21,196,the united states insufficient energy production transportation refining and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our na tions economy national security and foreign policy

14152,4,65,bidens son had abandoned his laptop at a computer repair business

14152,6,198,before being issued the letter was sent to the cia prepublication classifica tion review board the body typically assigned to formally evaluate the sensitive nature of documents prior to publication
14152,7,181,senior cia officials were made aware of the contents of the letter and multiple signatories held clearances at the time and maintained ongoing contractual relationships with the cia
14152,8,257,federal policymakers must be able to rely on analysis conducted by the intelligence community and be confident that it is accurate crafted with professionalism and free from politically motivated engineering to affect political outcomes in the united states

14152,15,78,the book was rife with sensitive information drawn from his time in government
14152,16,184,the memoirs reckless treatment of sensitive information undermined the ability of future presidents to request and obtain candid advice on matters of national security from their staff
14152,17,83,publication also created a grave risk that classified material was publicly exposed

14147,4,141,these actions appear oriented more toward inflicting political pain than toward pursuing actual justice or legitimate governmental objectives
14147,5,342,many of these activities appear to be inconsistent with the constitution andor the laws of the united states including those activities directed at parents protesting at school board meetings americans who spoke out against the previous administrations actions and other ameri cans who were simply exercising constitutionally protected rights

14147,8,80,the department of justice even jailed an individual for posting a political meme
